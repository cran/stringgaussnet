	abstract = {Gene regulation networks are composed of transcription factors, their interactions, and targets. It is of great interest to reconstruct and study these regulatory networks from genomics data. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are popular tools to model the dynamic system of gene regulation networks. Although the form of ODEs is often provided based on expert knowledge, the values for ODE parameters are seldom known. It is a challenging problem to infer ODE parameters from gene expression data, because the ODEs do not have analytic solutions and the time-course gene expression data are usually sparse and associated with large noise. In this chapter, we review how the generalized profiling method can be applied to obtain estimates for ODE parameters from the time-course gene expression data. We also summarize the consistency and asymptotic normality results for the generalized profiling estimates.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces the well-known Monte Carlo simulation technique. The technique applies to both deterministic and probabilistic models to study properties of stable systems that are in equilibrium. A random number generator (RNG) is used by Monte Carlo to simulate a performance measure drawn from a population with appropriate statistical properties. The Monte Carlo algorithm is based on the law of large numbers with the promise that the mean value of a large number of samples from a given space will approximate the actual mean value of such a space. To understand Monte Carlo simulation, two examples are introduced: a toy example and an electric car charging station. Both examples estimated the average value using a large number of samples. The examples illustrated that the Monte Carlo technique will estimate the described value without considering all possible sequences of arrivals.

	abstract = {SUMMARY: With the rapid advances and prevalence of high-throughput genomic technologies, integrating information of multiple relevant genomic studies has brought new challenges. Microarray meta-analysis has become a frequently used tool in biomedical research. Little effort, however, has been made to develop a systematic pipeline and user-friendly software. In this article, we present MetaOmics, a suite of three R packages MetaQC, MetaDE and MetaPath, for quality control, differentially expressed gene identification and enriched pathway detection for microarray meta-analysis. MetaQC provides a quantitative and objective tool to assist study inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. MetaDE and MetaPath were developed for candidate marker and pathway detection, which provide choices of marker detection, meta-analysis and pathway analysis methods. The system allows flexible input of experimental data, clinical outcome (case-control, multi-class, continuous or survival) and pathway databases. It allows missing values in experimental data and utilizes multi-core parallel computing for fast implementation. It generates informative summary output and visualization plots, operates on different operation systems and can be expanded to include new algorithms or combine different types of genomic data. This software suite provides a comprehensive tool to conveniently implement and compare various genomic meta-analysis pipelines.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify genes that could predict response to doxorubicin-based primary chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Biopsy samples were obtained before primary treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. RNA was extracted and amplified and gene expression was analyzed using cDNA microarrays.
RESULTS: Response to chemotherapy was evaluated in 51 patients, and based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines, 42 patients, who presented at least a partial response ({\textgreater} or =30\% reduction in tumor dimension), were classified as responsive. Gene profile of samples, divided into training set (n = 38) and independent validation set (n = 13), were at first analyzed against a cDNA microarray platform containing 692 genes. Unsupervised clustering could not separate responders from nonresponders. A classifier was identified comprising EMILIN1, FAM14B, and PBEF, which however could not correctly classify samples included in the validation set. Our next step was to analyze gene profile in a more comprehensive cDNA microarray platform, containing 4,608 open reading frame expressed sequence tags. Seven samples of the initial training set (all responder patients) could not be analyzed. Unsupervised clustering could correctly group all the resistant samples as well as at least 85\% of the sensitive samples. Additionally, a classifier, including PRSS11, MTSS1, and CLPTM1, could correctly distinguish 95.4\% of the 44 samples analyzed, with only two misclassifications, one sensitive sample and one resistant tumor. The robustness of this classifier is 2.5 greater than the first one.
CONCLUSION: A trio of genes might potentially distinguish doxorubicin-responsive from nonresponsive tumors, but further validation by a larger number of samples is still needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To validate the use of cDNA based microarray on synovial biopsies by analysing the experimental variability due to amplification of RNA, reproducibility of the assay, heterogeneity of the tissue, and statistical analysis.
METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from three spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and three osteoarthritis (OA) synovial tissue biopsy specimens and from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of four healthy donors. Exponential RNA amplification by SMART-PCR was compared with linear amplification. Reproducibility was tested by comparing different microarray systems and by performing duplicate experiments. Sample heterogeneity was assessed by comparing overall gene expression profiles, histopathology, and analysis of genes expressed in the synovium and normal PBMC. Statistical analysis using t test and Bonferroni adjustment was verified by permutation of class labels.
RESULTS: Gene expression was concordant in 12/14 (86\%) cytokine/chemokine genes between both microarrays and different RNA amplification systems. When one microarray system was used, expressed genes were 78-95\% concordant in duplicate experiments. Gene expression profiles had a higher degree of similarity between SpA synovium than between PBMC or OA synovium despite clear histopathological differences between synovial samples. Comparison of SpA synovium with OA synovium and with PBMC yielded 11 and 18 expressed transcripts, respectively; six were shared in both comparisons. Permutations of SpA and OA samples yielded only one expressed gene in 19 comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that microarrays can be used for analysis of synovial tissue biopsies with high reproducibility and low variability of the generated gene expression profiles.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PD-1 polymorphisms and haplotypes with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese Han population. In a case-control association study, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), PD-1.3 G/A, PD-1.5 C/T and PD-1.9 T/C, were genotyped in 216 AS patients and 264 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. All genotype distributions in the patients and in the controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The associations of genotypes and alleles with AS were analyzed. The genotype distributions of PD-1.9 were significantly different between the patients with AS and the controls (P = 0.025). The frequencies of TC genotype and T allele of PD-1.9 were higher in the patients than those in the controls (P = 0.026 and 0.004). No association for PD-1.5 in AS was found, and PD-1.3 was non-polymorphic in Chinese Han population. Moreover, the frequency of the CT haplotype (PD-1.5 C/T, PD-1.9 T/C) was significantly higher in AS patients than the controls (21.6 vs. 13.9\%, P = 0.002). The CC haplotype was more common in the controls than in the patients (57.1 vs. 44.6\%, P = 0.000). The results support a genetic association between the PD-1 polymorphism and susceptibility to AS in Chinese Han population.},

	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0086822},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High frequency of physical aggression is the central feature of severe conduct disorder and is associated with a wide range of social, mental and physical health problems. We have previously tested the hypothesis that differential DNA methylation signatures in peripheral T cells are associated with a chronic aggression trajectory in males. Despite the fact that sex differences appear to play a pivotal role in determining the development, magnitude and frequency of aggression, most of previous studies focused on males, so little is known about female chronic physical aggression. We therefore tested here whether or not there is a signature of physical aggression in female DNA methylation and, if there is, how it relates to the signature observed in males.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Methylation profiles were created using the method of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) followed by microarray hybridization and statistical and bioinformatic analyses on T cell DNA obtained from adult women who were found to be on a chronic physical aggression trajectory (CPA) between 6 and 12 years of age compared to women who followed a normal physical aggression trajectory. We confirmed the existence of a well-defined, genome-wide signature of DNA methylation associated with chronic physical aggression in the peripheral T cells of adult females that includes many of the genes similarly associated with physical aggression in the same cell types of adult males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study in a small number of women presents preliminary evidence for a genome-wide variation in promoter DNA methylation that associates with CPA in women that warrant larger studies for further verification. A significant proportion of these associations were previously observed in men with CPA supporting the hypothesis that the epigenetic signature of early life aggression in females is composed of a component specific to females and another common to both males and females.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spondyloarthritides (SpA) are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. We studied cardiovascular risk factors in patients with SpA.
METHODS: The following risk factors were assessed in SpA patients and healthy controls: smoking, family history of premature ischemic heart disease, obesity, serum lipids, apolipoproteins, urate and carotid intima media thickness (IMT).
RESULTS: Overall 150 patients (73 with ankylosing spondylitis [AS], 71 with psoriatic arthritis [PsA] and six with other SpA types) were included. Generally SpA patients were significantly more often smokers, while PsA patients had greater values of abdominal obesity. AS patients had significantly lower levels of triglyceride, HDL, ApoB, ApoE and Lp(a) and a higher atherogenic index (total cholesterol/HDL). PsA patients had significantly lower levels of HDL, ApoAI and ApoE, an elevated atherogenic index and higher serum urate. In multivariate analysis the atherogenic index was positively associated with SpA across all patient groups independently of smoking and other lipid parameters. Carotid IMT in SpA patients (0.71 mm) was higher than controls (0.63 mm, P=0.017), although after adjusting for smoking this ceased to be significant. Treatment of patients with previously untreated disease resulted in a small but significant decline in ApoB levels at 6 months (P=0.045), which, however, was no longer evident at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Spondyloarthritis patients are at a greater cardiovascular risk owing to the higher prevalence of smoking and a higher atherogenic index. PsA patients have more abdominal fat and higher urate levels. Immunosuppressive treatment of SpA produces minor and temporary effects on the lipid profile.},

Despite the strong sequence divergence between the enhancers in sepsids and drosophilids, they lead to remarkably similar patterns of gene expression in transgenic Drosophila embryos.

	abstract = {Alternative cell differentiation pathways are believed to arise from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the prediction of mammalian cell differentiation from the knowledge of the presence of specific signals and transcriptional factors is still a daunting challenge. In this respect, the vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching differentiation pathways and cell types, is a compelling case study. In this paper, we propose an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. As most available data are qualitative, we rely on a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we use an original model reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm. To assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, we have performed a systematic series of simulations considering various prototypic environments. Consequently, we have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but these were found to coexist with other transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. In the process, our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. Finally, our logical model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.},

The significant improvements in signs and symptoms observed with TNF-blockers in this group of diseases, have raised the bar with regard to treatment goals, including clinical remission. Even if treatment failure with TNF-blocking agents may be a relatively rare phenomenon, cases of primary non-responders, secondary loss-of-efficacy and intolerance, have been described. Results with abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab - all effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis - were disappointing, especially in patients that had previously failed anti-TNF therapy. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that targeting the cytokines of the Th-17 axis is associated with major improvements of skin psoriasis and its associated arthritis. In axial spondyloarthritis, preliminary proof-of-concept studies with ustekinumab and interleukin-17 targeting therapies suggest that these agents could become the first new treatment options, not targeting TNF.

	abstract = {Lornoxicam (chlortenoxicam), a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, is available in oral and parenteral formulations. It is distinguished from established oxicams by a relatively short elimination half-life (3 to 5 hours), which may be advantageous from a tolerability standpoint. Data from preliminary clinical trials suggest that lornoxicam is as effective as the opioid analgesics morphine, pethidine (meperidine) and tramadol in relieving postoperative pain following gynaecological or orthopaedic surgery, and as effective as other NSAIDs after oral surgery. Lornoxicam was also as effective as other NSAIDs in relieving symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute sciatica and low back pain. Lornoxicam has a tolerability profile characteristic of an NSAID, with gastrointestinal disturbances being the most common adverse events. Limited clinical experience to date suggests that, as with a number of other NSAIDs, lornoxicam may provide a better-tolerated alternative or adjuvant to opioid analgesics for the management of moderate to severe pain. It has also demonstrated potential as an alternative to other NSAIDs for the management of arthritis and other painful and inflammatory conditions.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Axial spondyloarthropathy (SpA) is a group of inflammatory diseases, with ankylosing spondylitis as the prototype. SpA affects the axial skeleton, entheses, joints and, at times, the eyes. This study tested the hypothesis that SpA is characterized by a distinct pattern of gene expression in peripheral blood of affected individuals compared with healthy controls.
METHODS: High-density, human GeneChip probe arrays were used to profile mRNA of peripheral blood cells from 18 subjects with SpA and 25 normal individuals. Samples were processed as two separate sets at different times (11 SpA + 12 control subjects in primary set (Set 1); 7 SpA+ 13 control subjects in the validation set (Set 2)). Blood samples were taken at a time when patients were not receiving systemic immunomodulatory therapy. Differential expression was defined as a 1.5-fold change with a q value {\textless} 5\%. Gene ontology and pathway information were also studied.
RESULTS: Signals from 134 probe sets (representing 95 known and 12 unknown gene transcripts) were consistently different from controls in both Sets 1 and 2. Included among these were transcripts for a group of 20 genes, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors 1 and 2, Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 2 (NLRP2), secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) that are clearly related to the immune or inflammatory response and a group of 4 transcripts that have a strong role in bone remodeling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations are the first to implicate SPARC, SLPI, and NLRP2, a component of the innate immune system, in the pathogenesis of SpA. Our results also indicate a possible role for IL-1 and its receptors in SpA. In accord with the bone pathology component of SpA, we also found that expression levels of transcripts reflecting bone remodeling factors are also distinguishable in peripheral blood from patients with SpA versus controls. These results confirm some previously identified biomarkers implicated in the pathogenesis of SpA and also point to novel mediators in this disease.},

RNA collected after treatment (at 1, 3, 7, and 24 h) rather than after a single time point, enabled an analysis of gene expression patterns. Using a 17,000 microarray, template-based clustering and multidimensional scaling analysis of the gene expression over the entire time course identified 421 genes as being either up- or down-regulated by the three oxidants. In contrast, only 127 genes were identified for any single time point and a 2-fold change criteria. Surprisingly, the patterns of gene induction were highly similar among the three oxidants; however, differences were observed, particularly with respect to p53, IL-6, and heat-shock related genes. Replicate experiments increased the statistical confidence of the study, whereas changes in gene expression patterns over a time course demonstrated significant additional information versus a single time point. Analyzing the three oxidants simultaneously by template cluster analysis identified genes that heretofore have not been associated with oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

It is now more important than ever to diagnose and treat SpA early. New therapeutic agents including blockers of tumor necrosis factor have yielded tremendous responses not only in advanced disease but also in the early stages of the disease. Sacroiliitis on conventional radiography is the result of structural changes which may appear late in the disease process. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualize active inflammation at sacroiliac joints and spine in recent onset disease. The modified New York criteria, the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group criteria and the Amor criteria do not include advanced imaging techniques like MRI which is very sensitive to the early Inflammatory changes. Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society has defined MRI methods for the assessment of sacroiliac joints and spine, criteria for inflammatory back pain and developed new criteria for classification of axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis. These new criteria are intended to be used for patients with SpA at the very early stage of their disease. Also, classification of psoriatic arthritis study group developed criteria for the classification of PsA. The widespread use of these criteria in clinical trials will provide evidence for a better definition of early disease and recognize many patients who may further develop classical AS or PsA. These efforts will guide therapeutic trials of potent drugs like biological agents in the early stage of these diseases.},

Rats from one transgenic line spontaneously developed inflammatory disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, peripheral and vertebral joints, male genital tract, skin, nails, and heart. This pattern of organ system involvement showed a striking resemblance to the B27-associated human disorders. These results establish that B27 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the multi-organ system processes of the spondyloarthropathies.

	abstract = {Given the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the world, the search for genetic variations controlling the levels of risk factors associated with the development of the disease continues. Multiple genetic association studies suggest the involvement of procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-2 (PCPE2) in modulating HDL-C levels. Therefore biochemical and mechanistic studies were undertaken to determine whether there might be a basis for a role of PCPE2 in HDL biogenesis. Our studies indicate that PCPE2 accelerates the proteolytic processing of pro-apolipoprotein (apo) AI by enhancing the cleavage of the hexapeptide extension present at the N terminus of apoAI. Surface Plasmon Resonance and immunoprecipitation studies indicate that PCPE2 interacts with BMP-1 and pro-apoAI to form a ternary pro-apoAI/BMP-1/PCPE2 complex. The most favorable interaction among these proteins begins with the association of BMP-1 to pro-apoAI followed by the binding of PCPE2 which further stabilizes the complex. PCPE2 resides, along with apoAI, on the HDL fraction of lipoproteins in human plasma supporting a relationship between HDL and PCPE2. Taken together, the findings from our studies identify a new player in the regulation of apoAI post-translational processing and open a new avenue to the study of mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoAI synthesis, HDL levels, and potentially, cardiovascular disease.},

Meta-analysis was performed with fixed/random effect models. Overall, no significant RA/AS risk was found in all genetic models when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (P{\textgreater}0.05).

We present edgeRun, an R package that implements an unconditional exact test that is a more powerful version of the exact test in edgeR. This increase in power is especially pronounced for experiments with as few as 2 replicates per condition, for genes with low total expression and with large biological coefficient of variation. In comparison with a panel of other tools, edgeRun consistently captures functionally similar differentially expressed genes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze lipid changes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) treated with biologic agents or tofacitinib in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed, using the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge databases. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to assess changes in the percentage of patients with abnormal lipid values or in the mean percentage of increase in the cholesterol and triglycerides levels.
RESULTS: Twenty-five of 4,527 identified articles met the inclusion criteria. Compared with RA patients treated with placebo, those treated with tocilizumab were more likely to have hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR] 4.64; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 2.71, 7.95 [P {\textless} 0.001]), increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (OR 2.25; 95\% CI 1.14, 4.44 [P = 0.020]), and increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (OR 4.80; 95\% CI 3.27, 7.05 [P {\textless} 0.001]); this was not observed in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (OR 1.54; 95\% CI 0.90, 2.66 [P = 0.119]) or tofacitinib (OR 3.4; 95\% CI 0.62, 18.55 [P = 0.158]). Among patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, the mean percentage of increases in the HDL cholesterol level (weighted mean difference [WMD] 13.00 mg/dl; 95\% CI 12.08, 13.93 [P {\textless} 0.001]) and the LDL cholesterol level (WMD 11.20 mg/dl; 95\% CI 10.08, 12.32 [P {\textless} 0.001]) were higher than those in the comparator groups. Among patients treated with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, the mean percentage of increases in the HDL cholesterol level (WMD 15.21 mg/dl; 95\% CI 13.28, 17.14 [P {\textless} 0.001]) and the LDL cholesterol level (WMD 15.42 mg/dl; 95\% CI 11.77, 19.06 [P {\textless} 0.001]) were also higher than those in the comparator groups. No data were available for RA treated with other biologic agents or for SpA.
CONCLUSION: In patients with RA treated with tocilizumab or tofacitinib but not with TNF antagonists, moderate changes in lipids are observed. Whether these changes pertain to the control of inflammation or to the mechanism of action of the biologic agents or tofacitinib remains undetermined.},

We identified 13 new risk loci and 12 additional ankylosing spondylitis-associated haplotypes at 11 loci. Two ankylosing spondylitis-associated regions have now been identified encoding four aminopeptidases that are involved in peptide processing before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation.

	abstract = {Alternative cell differentiation pathways are believed to arise from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the prediction of mammalian cell differentiation from the knowledge of the presence of specific signals and transcriptional factors is still a daunting challenge. In this respect, the vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching differentiation pathways and cell types, is a compelling case study. In this paper, we propose an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. As most available data are qualitative, we rely on a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we use an original model reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm. To assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation, we have performed a systematic series of simulations considering various prototypic environments. Consequently, we have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, but these were found to coexist with other transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. In the process, our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. Finally, our logical model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.},

	abstract = {A population association has consistently been observed between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the "class 1" alleles of the region of tandem-repeat DNA (5' flanking polymorphism [5'FP]) adjacent to the insulin gene on chromosome 11p. This finding suggests that the insulin gene region contains a gene or genes contributing to IDDM susceptibility. However, several studies that have sought to show linkage with IDDM by testing for cosegregation in affected sib pairs have failed to find evidence for linkage. As means for identifying genes for complex diseases, both the association and the affected-sib-pairs approaches have limitations. It is well known that population association between a disease and a genetic marker can arise as an artifact of population structure, even in the absence of linkage. On the other hand, linkage studies with modest numbers of affected sib pairs may fail to detect linkage, especially if there is linkage heterogeneity. We consider an alternative method to test for linkage with a genetic marker when population association has been found. Using data from families with at least one affected child, we evaluate the transmission of the associated marker allele from a heterozygous parent to an affected offspring. This approach has been used by several investigators, but the statistical properties of the method as a test for linkage have not been investigated. In the present paper we describe the statistical basis for this "transmission test for linkage disequilibrium" (transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]). We then show the relationship of this test to tests of cosegregation that are based on the proportion of haplotypes or genes identical by descent in affected sibs. The TDT provides strong evidence for linkage between the 5'FP and susceptibility to IDDM. The conclusions from this analysis apply in general to the study of disease associations, where genetic markers are usually closely linked to candidate genes. When a disease is found to be associated with such a marker, the TDT may detect linkage even when haplotype-sharing tests do not.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha inhibitors block a key protein in the inflammatory chain reaction responsible for joint inflammation, pain, and damage in ankylosing spondylitis.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefit and harms of adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab (TNF-alpha inhibitors) in people with ankylosing spondylitis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to January 26, 2009: MEDLINE (from 1966); EMBASE (from 1980); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2008, Issue 4); ACP Journal Club; CINAHL (from 1982); and ISI Web of Knowledge (from 1900). We ran updated searches in May 2012, October 2013, and in June 2014 for McMaster PLUS. We searched major regulatory agencies for safety warnings and clinicaltrials.gov for registered trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab to placebo, other drugs or usual care in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, reported in abstract or full-text.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed search results, risk of bias, and extracted data. We conducted Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analyses using WinBUGS software. To investigate a class-effect of harms across biologics, we pooled harms data using Review Manager 5.
MAIN RESULTS: We included twenty-one, short-term (24 weeks or less) RCTs with a total of 3308 participants; 18 contributed data to the MTC analysis: adalimumab (4 studies), etanercept (8 studies), golimumab (2 studies), infliximab (3 studies), and one head-to-head study (etanercept versus infliximab) which was unblinded and considered at a higher risk of bias. The risk of selection and detection bias was low or unclear for most of the studies. The risk of selective outcome reporting was low for most studies as they reported on outcomes recommended by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society. We found little heterogeneity and no significant inconsistency in the MTC analyses. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Most studies permitted concomitant therapy of stable doses of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids, but allowances varied across studies.Compared with placebo, there was high quality evidence that patients on an anti-TNF agent were three to four times more likely to achieve an ASAS40 response (assessing spinal pain, function, and inflammation, as measured by the mean of intensity and duration of morning stiffness, and patient global assessment) by six months (adalimumab: risk ratio (RR) 3.53, 95\% credible interval (Crl) 2.49 to 4.91; etanercept: RR 3.31, 95\% Crl 2.38 to 4.53; golimumab: RR 2.90, 95\% Crl 1.90 to 4.23; infliximab: RR 4.07, 95\% Crl 2.80 to 5.74, with a 25\% to 40\% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve an ASAS 40 response ranged from 3 to 5.There was high quality evidence of improvement in physical function on a 0 to 10 scale (adalimumab: mean difference (MD) -1.6, 95\% Crl -2.2 to -0.9; etanercept: MD -1.1, 95\% CrI -1.6 to -0.6; golimumab: MD -1.5, 95\% Crl -2.3 to -0.7; infliximab: MD -2.1, 95\% Crl -2.7 to -1.4, with an 11\% to 21\% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The NNT to achieve the minimally clinically important difference of 0.7 points ranged from 2 to 4.Compared with placebo, there was moderate quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision) that patients on an anti-TNF agent were more likely to achieve an ASAS partial remission by six months (adalimumab: RR 6.28, 95\% Crl 3.13 to 12.78; etanercept: RR 4.24, 95\% Crl 2.31 to 8.09; golimumab: RR 5.18, 95\% Crl 1.90 to 14.79; infliximab: RR 15.41, 95\% Crl 5.09 to 47.98 with a 10\% to 44\% absolute difference between treatment and placebo groups. The NNT to achieve an ASAS partial remission response ranged from 3 to 11.There was low to moderate level evidence of a greater reduction in spinal inflammation as measured by magnetic resonance imaging though the absolute differences were small and the clinical relevance of the difference was unclear: adalimumab (1 trial; -6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) -12\% to 0.05\%); 1 trial: 53.6\% mean decrease from baseline versus 9.4\% mean increase in the placebo group), golimumab (1 trial; -2.5\%, (95\% CI -5.6\% to -0.7\%)), and infliximab (1 trial; -3\% (95\% CI -4\% to -2.4\%)).Radiographic progression was measured in one trial (N = 60) of etanercept versus placebo and it found that radiologic changes were similar in both groups (detailed data not provided).There were few events of withdrawals due to adverse events leading to imprecision around the estimates. When all the anti-TNF agents were combined against placebo, there was moderate quality evidence from 16 studies of an increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse events in the anti-TNF group (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.44, 95\% CI 1.26 to 4.72; total events: 38/1637 in biologic group; 7/986 in placebo) though the absolute increase in harm was small (1\%; 95\% CI 0\% to 2\%).Due to low event rates, evidence of the effect of individual TNF-inhibitors against placebo or for all four biologics pooled together versus placebo on serious adverse events is inconclusive (moderate quality; downgraded for imprecision). For all anti-TNF pooled versus placebo based on 16 studies: Peto OR 1.45, 95\% CI 0.85 to 2.48; 51/1530 in biologic group; 18/878 in placebo; absolute difference: 1\% (95\% CI 0\% to 2\%).Using indirect comparison methodology, and one head-to-head study of etanercept versus infliximab, wide confidence intervals meant that results were inconclusive for evidence of differences in the major outcomes between different anti-TNF agents. Regulatory agencies have published warnings about rare adverse events of serious infections, including tuberculosis, malignancies and lymphoma.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate to high quality evidence that anti-TNF agents improve clinical symptoms in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. More participants withdrew due to adverse events when on an anti-TNF agent but we did not find evidence of an increase in serious adverse events, though event rates were low and trials had a short duration. The short-term toxicity profile appears acceptable. Based on indirect comparison methodology, we are uncertain whether there are differences between anti-TNF agents in terms of the key benefit or harm outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses, and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems. HLA typing for HLA-B27, HLA-B60, and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers, and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers. Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx, using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS.
RESULTS: Six of 8 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were disease concordant, compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (27\%) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall (12.5\%). Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins. HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands, and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1. Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97\% of the population variance.
CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined, and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous. HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The immune inflammatory disorders rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis (Ps) share common pathologic features and show responsiveness to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents yet they are phenotypically distinct. The aim of this study was to examine if anti-TNF therapy is associated with divergent gene expression profiles in circulating cells and target tissues of patients with these diseases.
METHODS: Peripheral blood CD14+ and CD14- cells were isolated from 9 RA, 12 PsA and 10 Ps patients before and after infliximab (IFX) treatment. Paired synovial (n=3, RA, PsA) and skin biopsies (n=5, Ps) were also collected. Gene expression was analyzed by microarrays.
RESULTS: 26 out of 31 subjects responded to IFX. The transcriptional response of CD14+ cells to IFX was unique for the three diseases, with little overlap ({\textless}25\%) in significantly changed gene lists (with PsA having the largest number of changed genes). In Ps, altered gene expression was more pronounced in lesional skin (relative to paired, healthy skin) compared to blood (relative to healthy controls). Marked suppression of up-regulated genes in affected skin was noted 2 weeks after therapy but the expression patterns differed from uninvolved skin. Divergent patterns of expression were noted between the blood cells and skin or synovial tissues in individual patients. Functions that promote cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in all three diseases were enriched. RA was enriched in functions in CD14- cells, PsA in CD14+ cells and Ps in both CD14+ and CD14- cells, however, the specific functions showed little overlap in the 3 disorders.
CONCLUSION: Divergent patterns of altered gene expression are observed in RA, PsA and Ps patients in blood cells and target organs in IFX responders. Differential gene expression profiles in the blood do not correlate with those in target organs.},

Here we describe a new, efficient method for the analysis of dense genetic maps in pedigree data that provides extremely fast solutions to common problems such as allele-sharing analyses and haplotyping. We show that sparse binary trees represent patterns of gene flow in general pedigrees in a parsimonious manner, and derive a family of related algorithms for pedigree traversal. With these trees, exact likelihood calculations can be carried out efficiently for single markers or for multiple linked markers. Using an approximate multipoint calculation that ignores the unlikely possibility of a large number of recombinants further improves speed and provides accurate solutions in dense maps with thousands of markers. Our multipoint engine for rapid likelihood inference (Merlin) is a computer program that uses sparse inheritance trees for pedigree analysis; it performs rapid haplotyping, genotype error detection and affected pair linkage analyses and can handle more markers than other pedigree analysis packages.},

	volume = {1},
	issn = {1469-493X},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD008951.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even with optimal disease-modifying treatment and good control of disease activity, persistent pain due to structural damage is common in people with inflammatory arthritis and therefore additional treatment for pain might be required. Because comorbidity is highly prevalent in people with inflammatory arthritis, it is important to consider comorbidities such as gastrointestinal or liver diseases in deciding upon optimal pharmacologic pain therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological pain treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis who have gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities, or both.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies to June 2010. We also searched the 2007-2010 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a hand search of reference lists of articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) were considered for inclusion for assessment of efficacy. For safety we also considered single arm trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, cohort and case-control studies, and case series of 10 or more consecutive cases. Pain therapy comprised paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs (tramadol) and neuromodulators (anti-depressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants). The study population comprised adults ({\textgreater}18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis who had gastrointestinal and/or hepatic comorbid conditions. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function and quality of life. Studies that included a mixed population of inflammatory arthritis and other conditions were included only if results for inflammatory arthritis were reported separately.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: Out of 2869 articles only one single arm open trial was identified that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. This trial assessed the safety and efficacy of naproxen (dosage not specified) in 58 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal comorbidities for up to 52 weeks. Thirteen participants (22\%) remained on gold therapy, four participants (10\%) remained on hydroxychloroquine, 27 (47\%) remained on corticosteroids, 12 (21\%) remained on salicylates and all participants continued on antacids and bland diet. The presence of faecal occult blood was reported in 1/58 participants tested between weeks 1 to 26 and 2/32 participants tested between weeks 27 to 52. Over the course of the study, seven participants (12.1\%) withdrew due to adverse events but of these, only two participants withdrew due to gastrointestinal side effects (abdominal pain n=1, nausea n=1) and no serious adverse events were reported. Noteable, out of 14 studies excluded due to inclusion of mixed population (osteoarthritis or other rheumatic conditions) or intervention already withdrawn, five trials reported higher risk of developing gastrointestinal events in patients with prior gastrointestinal events when treated with NSAIDs.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the current review, there is scant evidence to guide clinicians about how gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities should influence the choice of pain treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondylarthritis. Based upon additional studies that included a mixed population of participants with a range of rheumatic conditions, NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory arthritis and a history of gastrointestinaI comorbidity as there is consistent evidence that they may be at increased risk.},

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression MM-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.},

	abstract = {Rats transgenic for the human MHC class I gene HLA-B27 are susceptible to a spontaneous multisystem inflammatory disease that resembles human B27-associated disease. This disease requires a high level of expression of the B27 transgene product in cells of hemopoietic origin and can be adoptively transferred to B27 transgenic or nontransgenic rats by transplantation of bone marrow (BM) or fetal liver (FL) cells. To investigate the role played by T cells and the thymus in the disease process, we produced congenitally athymic rnu/rnu F344 rats carrying the disease-prone B27 transgenic locus of the 33-3 line. Transgenic nude rats were protected from disease manifestations. This protection was abated by reconstitution with T cells from euthymic donors of the 33-3 line, with CD4 T cells being more efficient than CD8 T cells in transferring disease. Lethally irradiated, adult-thymectomized (ATX), nontransgenic recipients reconstituted with intact BM, T cell-depleted BM, FL, or nude BM from syngeneic disease-prone lines all developed disease. Pretreatment of the ATX nontransgenic recipients to deplete T cells enhanced the subsequent transferred disease. The inflammatory disease of B27 transgenic rats is thus T cell-dependent. The relevant T cells do not need to encounter B27 in the thymus, and residual radioresistant and/or extrathymically derived host T cells are sufficient to mediate the adoptively transferred disease. The data are most consistent with a model of B27-mediated disease arising from a failure of tolerance and requiring a population of CD4 T cells.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of microarray-based methods to identify genes with disease-specific expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) of juvenile arthritis patients and healthy controls.
METHODS: Microarray data (Affymetrix U95Av2) from 26 PBMC and 20 SFMC samples collected from patients with active disease (classified by course according to ACR criteria) were analysed for expression patterns that correlated with disease characteristics. For comparison, PBMC gene expression profiles were obtained from 15 healthy controls. Real-time PCR was used for confirmation of gene expression differences.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis of gene expression patterns in PBMC identified 378 probe sets corresponding to 342 unique genes with differing expression levels between polyarticular course patients and controls (t test, P{\textless}0.0001). The genes represented by these probe sets were enriched for functions related to regulation of immune cell functions, receptor signalling as well as protein metabolism and degradation. Included in these probe sets were a group of CXCL chemokines with functions related to angiogenesis. Further analysis showed that, whereas angiogenic CXCL (ELR+) gene expression was elevated in polyarticular PBMC, expression of angiostatic CXCL (ELR-) chemokines was lower in polyarticular SFMC compared with corresponding pauciarticular samples (t test, P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that juvenile arthritis patients exhibit complex patterns of gene expression in PBMC and SFMC. The presence of disease-correlated biologically relevant gene expression patterns suggests that the power of this approach will allow better understanding of disease mechanisms, identify distinct clinical phenotypes in disease subtypes, and suggest new therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Susceptibility to spondyloarthritis (SpA) is largely genetically determined. To understand increasingly complex genetic associations, one approach is to study epistasis or genetic interactions. Several associations between HLA antigens and SpA including HLA-B27 have been reported. In this study, we investigated epistasis between common HLA class I risk antigens in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the most typical form of SpA.
METHODS: In 154 patients with AS and 5584 controls, HLA class I antigens were analysed for association with AS. Biological interaction was analysed by investigating whether the effects of the risk factors combined departed from additivity.
RESULTS: Apart from the association with HLA-B27, we found an association between HLA-B60 and AS (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.2 to 2.8). This was confirmed in a meta-analysis (OR 2.2; CI 1.8 to 2.8). While 18.2\% of AS patients had both HLA-B27 and HLA-B60, this combination was found in only 0.4\% of controls. Using AS patients without HLA-B27 and HLA-B60 as a reference, the relative risk (RR) for disease in HLA-B27-/HLA-B60+ patients was 1.2 (95\% CI 0.3 to 4.1). For HLA-B27+/HLA-B60- the RR was 69 (95\% CI 40 to 111) but increased to 342 (95\% CI 147 to 708) in HLA-B27+/HLA-B60+ patients. For the interaction, the relative excess risk due to interaction was 251, the attributable proportion was 0.8 and the synergy index was 4.7. The interaction was confirmed in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong epistatic interaction between HLA-B60 and HLA-B27 in AS susceptibility. As a result, individuals with the HLA-B27+/HLA-B60+ genotype are at a very high risk of developing AS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement.
RESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.

When it was discovered over 50 years ago the region was thought to specify histocompatibility genes, but their nature has been resolved only in the last two decades. Although many of the 224 identified gene loci (128 predicted to be expressed) are still of unknown function, we estimate that about 40\% of the expressed genes have immune system function. Over 50\% of the MHC has been sequenced twice, in different haplotypes, giving insight into the extraordinary polymorphism and evolution of this region. Several genes, particularly of the MHC class II and III regions, can be traced by sequence similarity and synteny to over 700 million years ago, clearly predating the emergence of the adaptive immune system some 400 million years ago. The sequence is expected to be invaluable for the identification of many common disease loci. In the past, the search for these loci has been hampered by the complexity of high gene density and linkage disequilibrium.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the functional capacity and gene expression profile of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DCs) in HLA-B27+ axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients and healthy controls.
METHODS: MD-DCs were differentiated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for seven days, starting from purified CD14+ monocytes and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for six and twenty four hours. Their capacity to stimulate allogeneic CD4+ T cells from unrelated healthy donor was tested. Transcriptomic study was performed with Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST microarrays. Gene expression levels were compared between patients and controls using a multivariate design under a linear model (LIMMA). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for validation of the most striking gene expression differences.
RESULTS: The stimulatory capacity of allogeneic CD4+ T cells by MD-DCs from SpA patients was decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 81 genes differentially expressed in MD-DCs between SpA patients and controls (P {\textless}0.01 and fold-change {\textless}0.66 or {\textgreater}1.5). Four selected genes were validated by q
RT-PCR: ADAMTS15, CITED2, F13A1 and SELL. Expression levels of ADAMTS15 and CITED2, encoding a metallopeptidase and a transcription factor, respectively, were inversely correlated with each other (R = 0.75, P = 0.0003). Furthermore, in silico analysis identified several genes of the Wnt signaling pathway having expression co-regulated with CITED2.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed altered function and gene expression pattern in MD-DCs from HLA-B27+ axial SpA. Co-expression study showed an inverse correlation between ADAMTS15 and CITED2. Moreover, the Wnt signaling pathway appeared as deregulated in SpA MD-DCs, a finding which may be connected to Th17-driven inflammatory responses.},

	title = {Animal models of {HLA}-{B}27-associated diseases},
	volume = {4},
	issn = {1566-5240},
	abstract = {The HLA-B27 molecule is strongly associated with the spondyloarthropathies (SpA), a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the skeleton, the skin and several mucosae. The mechanism of this association remains unknown, largely because the HLA-B27 molecule displays normal function. A disease that closely mimicks SpA arises spontaneously in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. This disease is dependent on the presence of a normal bacterial flora and implicates the immune system. The presence of both CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing high levels of HLA-B27, seems of critical importance in its pathogenesis, whereas CD8+ T cells are dispensable. The T cell stimulatory function of APCs is disturbed by the HLA-B27 molecule. This disease could result from a failure of tolerance, related in part to high level of B27 expression in professional APCs and to the immune response to gut bacteria. In contrast, HLA-B27 transgenic mice have usually remained healthy. However, two types of inflammatory conditions affecting the skeleton, which arise in mice of susceptible background after exposure to a conventional bacterial flora, are increased by an HLA-B27 transgene. The first is ANKENT, a spontaneous ankylosing enthesitis that affects ankle and/or tarsal joints of ageing mice; the second is a spontaneous arthritis of hindpaws developing in mice lacking endogenous mbeta2m. As in rats, the absence of CD8+ T cells in the latter model, argues against the "arthritogenic peptide" hypothesis. In these mbeta2m0 mice, B27 free heavy chain could be implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis by presenting extracellular peptides to CD4+ T cells.},

Eighty-eight patients diagnosed with AS were identified by analysis of the databases of a previous community intervention programme, the Västerbotten intervention programme. The patients were compared with 351 controls matched for age, sex and study period. These databases include the results of blood samples analysed for cholesterol, triglycerides and plasma glucose, as well as data on hypertension, height, weight, smoking and dietary habits and physical activity. No significant differences were found between patients and controls regarding hypertension, body mass index, physical activity, diet or smoking. Levels of serum triglycerides (p {\textless} 0.01) and cholesterol (p {\textless} 0.01) were significantly lower in the patient group. Among the patients, the level of triglycerides correlated inversely with the intake of total fat (r s = -0.25, p {\textless} 0.05), monounsaturated fats (r s = -0.29, p {\textless} 0.05) and positively correlated to the intake of carbohydrates (r s = 0.26, p {\textless} 0.05). These associations were not apparent among the controls. In the cohort of AS patients studied, no differences were found regarding the modifiable risk factors for CVD compared with the general population. Hence, the increased presence of CVD in patients with AS may be caused by other factors such as differences in metabolism and medication such as NSAID or the chronic low-grade inflammation present in the disease.},

However, fewer than 5\% of B27-positive individuals in the general population become affected. Genomewide scans suggest that other major histocompatibility complex genes further heighten this risk, although linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B27 has confounded their precise identification. Over 31 variants of HLA-B27 have been identified to date, which have evolved from the original B27 allele (B*2705) along three geographic lines. HLA-B*2705 and B*2702 are the primary subtypes in Caucasians with spondylitis, and B*2704 and B*2707 are the primary subtypes in Asians. HLA-B*2706 and B*2709 are not disease associated. There are four theories of how HLA-27 causes spondyloarthritis: (1) HLA-B27 presents a bacterially derived 'arthritogenic peptide' (not yet identified); (2) misfolding or homodimerization of HLA-B27 heavy chains results in a pro-inflammatory response; (3) HLA-B27-positive individuals have deficient intracellular killing of arthritogenic organisms; and (4) HLA-B27 itself, due to sequence homology with bacterial proteins, becomes autoantigenic.},

	volume = {14},
	issn = {1478-6362},
	doi = {10.1186/ar3857},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The pathology of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) suggests that certain cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) might provide useful markers of disease activity. Serum levels of some cytokines and MMPs have been found to be elevated in active disease, but there is a general lack of information about biomarker profiles in AS and how these are related to disease activity and function. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether clinical measures of disease activity and function in AS are associated with particular profiles of circulating cytokines and MMPs.
METHODS: Measurement of 30 cytokines, five MMPs and four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases was carried out using Luminex® technology on a well-characterised population of AS patients (n = 157). The relationship between biomarker levels and measures of disease activity (Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI)), function (Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index) and global health (Bath ankylosing spondylitis global health) was investigated. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the large number of biomarkers to a smaller set of independent components, which were investigated for their association with clinical measures. Further analyses were carried out using hierarchical clustering, multiple regression or multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Principal component analysis identified eight clusters consisting of various combinations of cytokines and MMPs. The strongest association with the BASDAI was found with a component consisting of MMP-8, MMP-9, hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL8, and was independent of C-reactive protein levels. This component was also associated with current smoking. Hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct patient clusters that could be separated on the basis of MMP levels. The high MMP cluster was associated with increased C-reactive protein, the BASDAI and the Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index.
CONCLUSIONS: A profile consisting of high levels of MMP-8, MMP-9, hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL8 is associated with increased disease activity in AS. High MMP levels are also associated with smoking and worse function in AS.},

It is found that the network of protein complexes is a small world network with scale free behavior for many of its distributions. However we find that there are no strong correlations between the weights and degrees of neighboring complexes. To reveal non-random features of the network we also compare it with a null model in which the complexes randomly select their proteins.

	abstract = {A number of inflammatory disease states occur with greatly increased frequency in individuals inheriting the human major histocompatibility complex class I allele HLA-B27. In a minority of cases, namely those with B27-associated reactive arthritis, there is good evidence that the disease state is triggered by infection with an enteric or genitourinary bacterial pathogen. For the majority of B27-associated disease, no definite pathogenetic role for bacteria has been established. However, in these latter cases intestinal inflammation can often be demonstrated, and it sometimes occupies a major part of the clinical picture. Rats transgenic for B27 are known to develop a disorder resembling B27-associated human disease, with prominent intestinal, joint, skin, and male genital inflammatory lesions. We report here that B27 transgenic rats raised in a germfree environment do not develop inflammatory intestinal or peripheral joint disease, whereas the skin and genital inflammatory lesions are unaffected by the germfree state. These findings support the concept that gut and joint inflammation are pathogenetically closely related, and they provide direct evidence that the commensal gut flora play an important role in the pathogenesis of B27-associated gut and joint inflammation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory back pain (IBP) is an important clinical symptom in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), and relevant for classification and diagnosis. In the present report, a new approach for the development of IBP classification criteria is discussed.
METHODS: Rheumatologists (n = 13) who are experts in SpA took part in a 2-day international workshop to investigate 20 patients with back pain and possible SpA. Each expert documented the presence/absence of clinical parameters typical for IBP, and judged whether IBP was considered present or absent based on the received information. This expert judgement was used as the dependent variable in a logistic regression analysis in order to identify those individual IBP parameters that contributed best to a diagnosis of IBP. The new set of IBP criteria was validated in a separate cohort of patients (n = 648).
RESULTS: Five parameters best explained IBP according to the experts. These were: (1) improvement with exercise (odds ratio (OR) 23.1); (2) pain at night (OR 20.4); (3) insidious onset (OR 12.7); (4) age at onset {\textless}40 years (OR 9.9); and (5) no improvement with rest (OR 7.7). If at least four out of these five parameters were fulfilled, the criteria had a sensitivity of 77.0\% and specificity of 91.7\% in the patients participating in the workshop, and 79.6\% and 72.4\%, respectively, in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: This new approach with real patients defines a set of IBP definition criteria using overall expert judgement on IBP as the gold standard. The IBP experts' criteria are robust, easy to apply and have good face validity.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD004524.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by sacroiliitis and spondylitis. To date, treatment of AS has been limited to the alleviation of symptoms, mainly using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients refractory or intolerant to NSAIDs, the disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been used as a second line approach. Methotrexate (MTX) is currently one of the most widely used DMARDs and its efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been confirmed (Suarez-Almazor 2003). There is uncertainty whether MTX works in the treatment of AS.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised trials in any language were sought using the following sources: CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 4 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003 Week 26), CINAHL (1982 to June Week 3 2003) and the reference section of retrieved articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We evaluated randomised and quasi-randomised trials examining the efficacy of methotrexate on AS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Unblinded trial reports were reviewed independently by two reviewers according to the selection criteria. Disagreements on the inclusion of the studies were resolved, where necessary, by recourse to a third reviewer. The methodological quality of included trials were independently assessed by the same reviewers on randomization, concealment, blindness (participants, care providers and outcome investigators), description of withdrawals and drop-outs and intention-to-treat analysis. The same reviewers independently entered the data extracted from the included trials, using RevMan's double entry facility. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results were combined using weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuous data, and relative risk for dichotomous data.
MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Altan 2001compared naproxen plus MTX (7.5 mg/week orally) with naproxen alone and Roychowdhury 2002 compared MTX (10 mg/week orally) with placebo. The duration of the trials were 12 months and 24 weeks, respectively. They assessed different outcomes except for C-reactive protein (CRP). The included trials treated a total of 81 patients and assessed more than 10 outcomes relevant to the review, covering function, pain, peripheral arthritis/enthesitis, morning stiffness, patient and physician global assessment, CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). No significant difference between intervention groups was found favouring MTX over no MTX. No serious side effect was reported in either trial.
REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant benefit of MTX in the examined outcomes for AS patients. High quality, larger sample and longer period of randomized controlled trials (possibly with higher dosage of MTX) are needed to verify the uncertainty about the efficacy and toxicity of MTX for the treatment of AS.},

	abstract = {Objective: Several polymorphisms in ERAP1 are strongly associated with susceptibility to spondyloarthritis (SpA). The combination of rs17482078, rs10050860 and rs30187 determines three major haplotypes with different levels of association with SpA ("protective" T/T/C; "neutral" C/C/C and "susceptibility" C/C/T). The aim of the present work was to determine whether such haplotypes might affect ERAP1 mRNA expression, protein level and/or enzymatic activity in antigen-presenting cells, a type of cell potentially relevant to disease pathogenesis. Methods: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DCs) were generated in two cohorts comprising a total of 23 SpA patients and 44 healthy controls. B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) were established from individuals homozygous for risk, neutral or protective ERAP1 haplotype respectively. In those samples, we investigated the relation between ERAP1 haplotypes and mRNA expression level. We also measured the relative protein expression of ERAP1 by Western blot and its enzymatic activity using a fluorogenic assay. Results: In MD-DCs, there was a strong association between ERAP1 haplotypes and ERAP1 mRNA expression level, with higher levels in subjects harboring the susceptibility haplotype in both cohorts (p = 0.001 and 5.6x10(-7) , respectively). In B-LCLs, we observed a significant correlation between haplotype risk score and ERAP1 transcript or protein level (p = 0.003, rho = 0.92 for both). Enzymatic activity followed a similar trend both in MD-DCs and in B-LCLs. Conclusions: Those data provide strong evidence that SpA-associated ERAP1 polymorphisms affect the level of gene expression in antigen-presenting cells. How an increased production/activity of ERAP1 may influence susceptibility to SpA remains to be determined. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mathematical concepts of graph theory and game theory both influence models of biological systems. We combine these two approaches to understand how game-like interactions influence the cellular topology of a planar tissue. We review the literature on the role of cell to cell interactions in tumourigenesis and survey the mathematical approaches that have been used to simulate such cell-cell interactions. We present how this game-graph approach can be used to simulate epithelial tissue growth and how it can foster our understanding of the role of cell-cell communication in the early stages of cancer development. We present computational models that we use to test how cooperating and non-cooperating cells build planar tissues and compare the simulated tissue topologies with literature data. We further discuss how such system could be used to model microenviromental communications between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the functional capacity and gene expression profile of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DCs) in HLA-B27+ axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients and healthy controls.
METHODS: MD-DCs were differentiated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for seven days, starting from purified CD14+ monocytes and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for six and twenty four hours. Their capacity to stimulate allogeneic CD4+ T cells from unrelated healthy donor was tested. Transcriptomic study was performed with Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST microarrays. Gene expression levels were compared between patients and controls using a multivariate design under a linear model (LIMMA). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for validation of the most striking gene expression differences.
RESULTS: The stimulatory capacity of allogeneic CD4+ T cells by MD-DCs from SpA patients was decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 81 genes differentially expressed in MD-DCs between SpA patients and controls (P {\textless}0.01 and fold-change {\textless}0.66 or {\textgreater}1.5). Four selected genes were validated by q
RT-PCR: ADAMTS15, CITED2, F13A1 and SELL. Expression levels of ADAMTS15 and CITED2, encoding a metallopeptidase and a transcription factor, respectively, were inversely correlated with each other (R = 0.75, P = 0.0003). Furthermore, in silico analysis identified several genes of the Wnt signaling pathway having expression co-regulated with CITED2.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed altered function and gene expression pattern in MD-DCs from HLA-B27+ axial SpA. Co-expression study showed an inverse correlation between ADAMTS15 and CITED2. Moreover, the Wnt signaling pathway appeared as deregulated in SpA MD-DCs, a finding which may be connected to Th17-driven inflammatory responses.},

Comparing these data against a common control dataset derived from 1,500 randomly selected healthy British individuals, we report initial association and independent replication in a North American sample of two new loci related to ankylosing spondylitis, ARTS1 and IL23R, and confirmation of the previously reported association of AITD with TSHR and FCRL3. These findings, enabled in part by increased statistical power resulting from the expansion of the control reference group to include individuals from the other disease groups, highlight notable new possibilities for autoimmune regulation and suggest that IL23R may be a common susceptibility factor for the major 'seronegative' diseases.},

The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

	shorttitle = {A new approach to defining disease status in ankylosing spondylitis},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Disease status, in terms of disease activity, disease progression and prognosis is difficult to define in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). No gold standard exists. Therefore, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), a self-administered instrument, has been developed as a new approach to defining disease activity in patients with AS.
METHODS: The index, designed by a multidisciplinary team with input from patients, consists of six 10 cm horizontal visual analog scales to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness (both qualitative and quantitative). The final BASDAI score has a range of 0 to 10. The index was distributed to a cross section of patients, including inpatients receiving 3 weeks of intensive physiotherapy treatment and hospital outpatients. BASDAI was completed by a total of 154 patients. Validation of the new instrument was achieved through analysis of user friendliness, reliability (consistency), score distribution and sensitivity to change. Comparisons were made with a previous Bath disease activity index (DAI) and the Newcastle Enthesis Index.
RESULTS: The BASDAI was found by patients to be quick and simple to complete (mean: 67 s). Test-retest reliability was good (r = 0.93; p {\textless} 0.001), as was the distribution of scores across the scale (score range: 0.5-10; mean: 4.31). BASDAI was sensitive to change, reflecting a 16\% (mean) improvement in inpatient scores after 3 weeks of treatment. It is superior to the DAI in terms of construct and content validity and to the Enthesis Index in all aspects.
CONCLUSION: In summary, BASDAI is user friendly, reliability, sensitive to change and reflects the entire spectrum of disease. It is a comprehensive self-administered instrument for assessing disease activity in AS.},

	doi = {10.1002/art.24780},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spondylarthritis (SpA) is characterized by spinal and peripheral joint inflammation, frequently combined with extraarticular manifestations. Despite the well-established association of SpA with the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele HLA-B27, there are still different, parallel hypotheses on the relationship between HLA-B27 and disease mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to investigate several characteristics of mature dendritic cells (DCs), which are believed to be essential for triggering disease in a model of SpA in HLA-B27-transgenic rats.
METHODS: We combined different whole-proteome approaches (2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and iTRAQ) to define the most aberrant molecular processes occurring in spleen DCs. Videomicroscopy and flow cytometry were used to confirm both cytoskeletal and class II MHC expression deficiencies.
RESULTS: Our proteome studies provided evidence of up-regulation of proteins involved in class I MHC loading, and unfolded protein response, along with a striking down-regulation of several cytoskeleton-reorganizing proteins. The latter result was corroborated by findings of deficient motility, altered morphology, and decreased immunologic synapse formation. Furthermore, class II MHC surface expression was reduced in DCs from B27-transgenic rats, and this could be linked to differences in class II MHC-induced apoptotic sensitivity. Finally, we found reduced viability of the CD103+CD4- DC subpopulation, which likely exerts tolerogenic function.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings have different important implications regarding the physiology of B27-transgenic rat DCs, which have a putative role in spontaneous disease in these rats. In particular, the reduced motility and viability of putatively tolerogenic CD4+ DCs could play an important role in initiating the inflammatory process, resulting in SpA.},

Here we report that microarray analysis of gene expression changes in the heart of these transgenic mice revealed that a cluster of ER stress-related genes was transcriptionally activated in the heart during the development of ischemic heart disease. The gene array results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR that showed highly elevated transcript levels of genes involved in unfolded protein response such as ER and cytoplasmic chaperones, oxidoreductases, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, and ER-associated degradation system such as ubiquitin. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of chaperones, PDI, and ubiquitin. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that ER stress proteins were associated mainly with the degenerating cardiomyocytes. A novel ubiquitin fold modifier (Ufm1) that has not been previously associated with ER stress and not found to be induced under any condition was also found to be upregulated in the hearts of MCP mice (transgenic mice that express MCP-1 specifically in the heart). The present results strongly suggest that activation of ER stress response is involved in the development of ischemic heart disease in this murine model.},

	doi = {10.1136/ard.2010.140574},
	abstract = {Modern technological innovations have advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of spondyloarthritis. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) accounts for nearly half of the predisposition, most comes from HLA-B27, for which 65 subtypes are now recognised, although other genes are also at work including HLA-B60 (B*40:01). Other genes have been identified, including those involved in peptide editing for loading onto class I MHC molecules (ERAP1) and cytokine genes such as interleukin 1A (IL-1A) and those involved in the Th17 network (IL-23R, an association seen primarily in Caucasians) and others. In acute anterior uveitis, these associations are also seen as well as a region on chromosome 9p and genes whose confirmation is under way. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis fall into this disease spectrum, with the largest region of susceptibility coming from the MHC (most likely HLA-C, ie, C*06:02 although additional influences are also being implicated), and most of the other genetic susceptibility coming from genes involved in cytokine production, specifically genes in the Th17 pathway (IL-12B, IL-23A and IL-23R, the latter, like in AS, not seen in Asians), genes in the nuclear factor κB pathway (TNFAIP3 and TNIP1) and genes in the Th2 pathway (IL-4 and IL-13). Given that more than half of patients with AS have evidence on colonoscopy of at least occult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is not surprising that shared genetic influences are operative. In IBD, genes important in the innate immune response (NOD2), autophagy (ATG6L1) and regulation of the IL-23 pathway (IL-23R) play a role in disease susceptibility.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To localize the regions containing genes that determine susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: One hundred five white British families with 121 affected sibling pairs with AS were recruited, largely from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases AS database. A genome-wide linkage screen was undertaken using 254 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from the Medical Research Council (UK) (MRC) set. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region was studied more intensively using 5 microsatellites lying within the HLA class III region and HLA-DRB1 typing. The Analyze package was used for 2-point analysis, and GeneHunter for multipoint analysis.
RESULTS: When only the MRC set was considered, 11 markers in 7 regions achieved a P value of {\textless} or =0.01. The maximum logarithm of odds score obtained was 3.8 (P = 1.4 x 10(-5)) using marker D6S273, which lies in the HLA class III region. A further marker used in mapping of the MHC class III region achieved a LOD score of 8.1 (P = 1 x 10(-9)). Nine of 118 affected sibling pairs (7.6\%) did not share parental haplotypes identical by descent across the MHC, suggesting that only 31\% of the susceptibility to AS is coded by genes linked to the MHC. The maximum non-MHC LOD score obtained was 2.6 (P = 0.0003) for marker D16S422.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm the strong linkage of the MHC with AS, and provide suggestive evidence regarding the presence and location of non-MHC genes influencing susceptibility to the disease.},

We identified and replicated trans-eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Although we did not study specific patient cohorts, we identified trait-associated SNPs that affect multiple trans-genes that are known to be markedly altered in patients: for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) SNP rs4917014 altered C1QB and five type 1 interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE-. Subsequent ChIP-seq data analysis on these trans-genes implicated transcription factor IKZF1 as the causal gene at this locus, with DeepSAGE RNA-sequencing revealing that rs4917014 strongly alters 3’ UTR levels of IKZF1. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.},

METHODS: A 588-gene microarray was used as a screening tool to select a panel of such genes from PBMC of these subjects and of normal subjects. Results were then validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: The following genes were more highly expressed in arthritis patients than in normal subjects: macrophage differentiation marker MNDA (myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen), MRP8 and MRP14 (migratory inhibitory factor-related proteins); signalling molecules JAK3 (janus kinase 3) and MAP kinase p38 (mitogen-activated protein kinase); receptors TNFR2/p75, C-C-chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1), C-X-C-chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and integrin beta1; and the cytokines/chemokines interleukin (IL) 1beta and IL-8. Expression of CXCR4 was unexpectedly high among all arthritis subjects. Using RT-PCR, ELISA and immunohistology, expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) was demonstrated in arthritis joints.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the genetic basis of susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), especially non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.
METHODS: The study group comprised 244 affected sibling pairs from 180 pedigrees of primarily European ancestry. Sibling pairs were concordant for AS by the modified New York criteria and had available sacroiliac radiographs. The subjects were genotyped for 400 markers in ABI PRISM linkage map MD-10 and for 17 additional markers on chromosomes 6p, 6q, and 11q (including HLA-B, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1 alleles). Two-point and multipoint nonparametric linkage (NPL) analyses were conducted using the NPL statistic and 1-parameter allele-sharing model logarithm of odds (LOD) scores, calculated using the Allele-Sharing Model (ASM) computer program.
RESULTS: Linkage of the MHC region was supported by both 2-point and multipoint analyses, with the strongest peak (45.90 cM) in the MHC at the HLA-DRB1 locus (NPL score 8.720, ASM LOD score 20.49; P = 6.8 x 10(-20) for 2-point analysis). A second region was found to have positive linkage at the q arm of chromosome 6 (D6S441) in 2-point analysis; this was supported by a 39.13-cM region (135.58-174.71 cM) in multipoint analysis, with the smallest P value (4.2 x 10(-3)) at 166.39 cM. A third region was found on chromosome 11q, with the strongest evidence for linkage for D11S4094 at 123 cM (NPL score 2.235, ASM LOD score 1.939) and, on transmission disequilibrium test analysis, D11S4090 at 105.74 cM (P = 6.2 x 10(-5)). Linkage in this area was supported by multipoint analysis, spanning 22.19 cM continuously from 101.68 cM to 123.87 cM, with the strongest peak at 112.33 cM (P = 0.014); this was confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies.
CONCLUSION: Thus, this genome-wide scan implicates, in addition to the MHC, regions outside the MHC in AS susceptibility, especially on chromosomes 6q and 11q.},

We therefore built up a relational database by systematically collating published data on the spread of activity after strychnine-induced disinhibition in the macaque cerebral cortex in vivo. After mapping these data to two different parcellation schemes, we used three independent methods of analysis which demonstrate that the cortical network of functional interactions is not homogeneous, but shows a clear segregation into functional assemblies of mutually interacting areas. The assemblies suggest a principal division of the cortex into visual, somatomotor and orbito-temporo-insular systems, while motor and somatosensory areas are inseparably interrelated. These results are largely compatible with corresponding analyses of structural data of mammalian cerebral cortex, and deliver the first functional evidence for 'small-world' architecture of primate cerebral cortex.},

Although the vaccine strains infected Mo-DC and replicated comparably with the fresh isolates, they accumulated far less matrix (M) protein.

Using a human thyroid follicle culture system, in which de novo synthesized thyroid hormones are released into the culture medium under physiological concentrations of human TSH, we studied the effects of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)], a chemical analog of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), on TSH-induced thyroid function. Thyrocytes expressed ligands for dsRNA (TLR 3, CD14, and retinoic-acid-inducible protein-1) comparable with the TSH receptor. DNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed that dsRNA increased the expression of mRNA for TLR3, IFN-beta, IFN-regulating factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC), whereas genes associated with thyroid hormonogenesis (sodium/iodide symporter, peroxidase, deiodinases) were suppressed. In accordance to these data, Poly(I:C) suppressed TSH-induced 125I uptake and hormone synthesis dose dependently, accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of 125I-T3/125I-T4 released into the culture medium, whereas peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharides, or unmethylated CpG DNA, ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, respectively, had no significant effect. These inhibitory effects of Poly(I:C) were not blocked by a neutralizing antibody against TLR3 and an anti-IFN alpha/beta receptor antibody. These in vitro findings suggest that when thyrocytes are infected with certain viruses, dsRNA formed intracellularly in thyrocytes may be a cause for thyroid dysfunction, leading to development of autoimmune thyroiditis.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1001195},
	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common inflammatory arthritic condition. Overt inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occurs in about 10\% of AS patients, and in addition 70\% of AS cases may have subclinical terminal ileitis. Spondyloarthritis is also common in IBD patients. We therefore tested Crohn's disease susceptibility genes for association with AS, aiming to identify pleiotropic genetic associations with both diseases. Genotyping was carried out using Sequenom and Applied Biosystems TaqMan and OpenArray technologies on 53 markers selected from 30 Crohn's disease associated genomic regions. We tested genotypes in a population of unrelated individual cases (n = 2,773) and controls (n = 2,215) of white European ancestry for association with AS. Statistical analysis was carried out using a Cochran-Armitage test for trend in PLINK. Strong association was detected at chr1q32 near KIF21B (rs11584383, P = 1.6 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95\% CI:0.68-0.82). Association with disease was also detected for 2 variants within STAT3 (rs6503695, P = 4.6 × 10(-4). OR = 0.86 (95\% CI:0.79-0.93); rs744166, P = 2.6 × 10(-5), OR = 0.84 (95\% CI:0.77-0.91)). Association was confirmed for IL23R (rs11465804, P = 1.2 × 10(-5), OR = 0.65 (95\% CI:0.54-0.79)), and further associations were detected for IL12B (rs10045431, P = 5.2 × 10(-5), OR = 0.83 (95\% CI:0.76-0.91)), CDKAL1 (rs6908425, P = 1.1 × 10(-4), OR = 0.82 (95\% CI:0.74-0.91)), LRRK2/MUC19 (rs11175593, P = 9.9 × 10(-5), OR = 1.92 (95\% CI: 1.38-2.67)), and chr13q14 (rs3764147, P = 5.9 × 10(-4), OR = 1.19 (95\% CI: 1.08-1.31)). Excluding cases with clinical IBD did not significantly affect these findings. This study identifies chr1q32 and STAT3 as ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility loci. It also further confirms association for IL23R and detects suggestive association with another 4 loci. STAT3 is a key signaling molecule within the Th17 lymphocyte differentiation pathway and further enhances the case for a major role of this T-lymphocyte subset in ankylosing spondylitis. Finally these findings suggest common aetiopathogenic pathways for AS and Crohn's disease and further highlight the involvement of common risk variants across multiple diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in reference to HLA-B27 in the French population.
METHODS: In 1989, 20 625 employees of the French national gas and electricity company aged 35-50 years were enrolled in the GAZEL cohort. In 2010, 18 757 still active participants were screened by a questionnaire validated for the detection of SpA. Responders with available DNA were retained for further studies. Pelvic radiograph and HLA-B27 typing were performed in all the self-reported cases of SpA or psoriatic arthritis. Self-reported diagnosis was verified by a qualified rheumatologist. HLA-B27 determination was also performed in subjects without any SpA feature.
RESULTS: The target population consisted of 6556 responders with available DNA. Their male:female ratio was 3.6 and their mean age was 65.5±3.3 years. A diagnosis of SpA was confirmed in 32 of the 72 self-reported cases, 75\% of them being HLA-B27 positive. Estimated SpA prevalence adjusted for sex was 0.43\% (95\% CI 0.26\% to 0.70\%). HLA-B27 positivity rate in 2466 healthy controls was 6.9\% (95\% CI 5.9\% to 7.9\%). The relative risk of SpA in HLA-B27 positive individuals was 39 (95\% CI 17 to 86).
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated the prevalence of SpA in the French population in 2010 to 0.43\%. With an estimated prevalence of 75.0\% in SpA and 6.9\% in healthy controls, HLA-B27 increased the disease risk 39-fold, as compared with HLA-B27 negative subjects.},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

METHODS: RNA was extracted from PBMCs collected from 18 patients with active disease and 18 gender-matched and age-matched controls. Expression profiles of these cells were determined using microarray. Candidate genes with differential expressions were confirmed in the same samples using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). These genes were then validated in a different sample cohort of 35 patients with AS and 18 controls by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 452 genes detected with 485 probes which were differentially expressed between patients with AS and controls. Underexpression of NR4A2, tumour necrosis factor AIP3 (TNFAIP3) and CD69 was confirmed. These genes were further validated in a different sample group in which the patients with AS had a wider range of disease activity. Predictive algorithms were also developed from the expression data using receiver-operating characteristic curves, which demonstrated that the three candidate genes have approximately 80\% power to predict AS according to their expression levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show differences in global gene expression patterns between patients with AS and controls, suggesting an immunosuppressive phenotype in the patients. Furthermore, downregulated expression of three immune-related genes was confirmed. These candidate genes were also shown to be strong predictive markers for AS.},

The human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL-60, U937, and THP-1, express similar levels of immunochemically detectable MNDA. Although, the level of MNDA mRNA in primary monocytes is very low it was up-regulated at 6 h following the addition of interferon alpha. The effect of interferon alpha on the MNDA mRNA is also observed in the cell lines HL-60, U937, and THP-1. The MNDA mRNA level in primary granulocytes was unaffected by addition of interferon alpha and other agents including interferon gamma, endotoxin, poly (I).poly (C), and FMLP. The MNDA mRNA level in the myeloid cell lines was also unaffected by the latter four agents. Induction of differentiation in the myeloid cell lines with phorbol ester induces monocyte differentiation which was accompanied by a decrease in MNDA mRNA level. This reduced level of mRNA could then be elevated with subsequent interferon alpha treatment. The effects of phorbol ester on MNDA mRNA appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of MNDA mRNA and cell cycle variation in MNDA mRNA levels were not observed. The ability of interferon alpha to up-regulate MNDA mRNA in phorbol ester treated myeloid cell lines is consistent with the observations made in primary monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We report here the identification of mutations in sterol-C4-methyl oxidase–like gene (SC4MOL) as the cause of an autosomal recessive syndrome in a human patient with psoriasiform dermatitis, arthralgias, congenital cataracts, microcephaly, and developmental delay. This gene encodes a sterol-C4-methyl oxidase (SMO), which catalyzes demethylation of C4-methylsterols in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. C4-Methylsterols are meiosis-activating sterols (MASs). They exist at high concentrations in the testis and ovary and play roles in meiosis activation. In this study, we found that an accumulation of MASs in the patient led to cell overproliferation in both skin and blood. SMO deficiency also substantially altered immunocyte phenotype and in vitro function. MASs serve as ligands for liver X receptors α and β(LXRα and LXRβ), which are important in regulating not only lipid transport in the epidermis, but also innate and adaptive immunity. Deficiency of SMO represents a biochemical defect in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, the clinical spectrum of which remains to be defined.},

	volume = {34},
	issn = {1488-2353},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genetic polymorphisms of the Interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including seronegative spondyloarthropathies. This study investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of IL-10 are associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a common subtype of spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: The serum levels of IL-10 were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -1082A/G, -819C/T and -592C/A in the IL-10 gene promoter were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: 110 AS patients and 120 ethnic-matched healthy controls were included in this study. The serum levels of IL-10 were significantly higher in AS patients than healthy controls (Z=-10.9, P {\textless} 0.001). Single SNP analysis showed no significant differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies of -592A/C between the AS patients and healthy controls. No -1082GG genotype was found in this study. An increased frequency of -1082G allele was noted in AS patients (P=0.047). In a logistic regression analysis, the -1082AG genotype was associated with an odds ratio of 1.993 (95\%CI, 1.046-3.800, P=0.034) for AS. And the -819CC genotype was associated with an odds ratio of 3.125 (95\%CI, 1.246-7.836, P=0.015) for AS. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that GCC haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of AS as compared with the ATA haplotype (OR=2.19; 95\% CI, 1.13-4.26; P=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the gene haplotype of IL-10 can contribute to the susceptibility to AS in a Chinese population.},

To investigate the role of B27 in these disorders, we introduced the B27 and human beta 2-microglobulin genes into rats, a species known to be quite susceptible to experimentally induced inflammatory disease. Rats from one transgenic line spontaneously developed inflammatory disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, peripheral and vertebral joints, male genital tract, skin, nails, and heart. This pattern of organ system involvement showed a striking resemblance to the B27-associated human disorders. These results establish that B27 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the multi-organ system processes of the spondyloarthropathies.

	abstract = {The recognition of sialic acids by two strains of minute virus of mice (MVM), MVMp (prototype) and MVMi (immunosuppressive), is an essential requirement for successful infection. To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-O-lactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc or 3'SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 3'SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N- and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 3'SIA-Le(X) identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.},

	abstract = {Analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) provides a means for detecting transcriptional regulatory relationships at a genome-wide scale. Here we explain the eQTL analysis pipeline, we introduce publicly available tools for the statistical analysis, and we discuss issues that might complicate the eQTL mapping process. The detection and interpretation of eQTL requires careful consideration of a range of potentially confounding effects. Particularly population substructure and batch effects may lead to the detection of many false-positive eQTL if not accounted for. Traditionally, most eQTL mapping methods only check for the correlation of single loci with gene expression. In order to detect (epistatic) interactions between distant genetic loci one has to take into account several loci simultaneously. Here, we present the Random Forest regression method as a way of accounting for interacting loci. Next, we introduce analysis methods aiding the biological interpretation of detected eQTL. For example, the notion of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTL has been very useful for interpreting the causes and implications of eQTL in many studies. In addition, Bayesian networks have been used extensively to infer causal relationships among eQTL and between eQTL and other genetic associations (e.g. disease associated loci). Also, the integration of eQTL with complementary information such as physical protein interaction data may significantly improve statistical power and provide insight into possible molecular mechanisms linking the regulator to its target gene. The eQTL approach is potentially very powerful for the analysis of regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility and other relevant traits. However, careful analysis is required to unleash its full potential.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-15-86},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that the development of cancer is caused by the accumulation of somatic mutations within the genome. For oncogenes specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of "driver" mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and their resulting tumors, a variety of approaches have been developed to identify potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and mutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary structure via a graph theoretical approach.
RESULTS: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino acid Clustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial structure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods. Specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in well known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory to account for the tertiary structure, GraphPAC discovers clusters in DPP4, NRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods. The R package is available at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GraphPAC.html.
CONCLUSION: GraphPAC provides an alternative to iPAC and an extension to current methodology when identifying potential activating driver mutations by utilizing a graph theoretic approach when considering protein tertiary structure.},

Three AS genome scans and one SpA scan including 430 families with 1,048 affected individuals were used. All four original genome scans mainly analyzed Caucasian families.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of microarray-based methods to identify genes with disease-specific expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) of juvenile arthritis patients and healthy controls.
METHODS: Microarray data (Affymetrix U95Av2) from 26 PBMC and 20 SFMC samples collected from patients with active disease (classified by course according to ACR criteria) were analysed for expression patterns that correlated with disease characteristics. For comparison, PBMC gene expression profiles were obtained from 15 healthy controls. Real-time PCR was used for confirmation of gene expression differences.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis of gene expression patterns in PBMC identified 378 probe sets corresponding to 342 unique genes with differing expression levels between polyarticular course patients and controls (t test, P{\textless}0.0001). The genes represented by these probe sets were enriched for functions related to regulation of immune cell functions, receptor signalling as well as protein metabolism and degradation. Included in these probe sets were a group of CXCL chemokines with functions related to angiogenesis. Further analysis showed that, whereas angiogenic CXCL (ELR+) gene expression was elevated in polyarticular PBMC, expression of angiostatic CXCL (ELR-) chemokines was lower in polyarticular SFMC compared with corresponding pauciarticular samples (t test, P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that juvenile arthritis patients exhibit complex patterns of gene expression in PBMC and SFMC. The presence of disease-correlated biologically relevant gene expression patterns suggests that the power of this approach will allow better understanding of disease mechanisms, identify distinct clinical phenotypes in disease subtypes, and suggest new therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {A key step toward the discovery of a gene related to a trait is the finding of an association between the trait and one or more haplotypes. Haplotype analyses can also provide critical information regarding the function of a gene; however, when unrelated subjects are sampled, haplotypes are often ambiguous because of unknown linkage phase of the measured sites along a chromosome. A popular method of accounting for this ambiguity in case-control studies uses a likelihood that depends on haplotype frequencies, so that the haplotype frequencies can be compared between the cases and controls; however, this traditional method is limited to a binary trait (case vs. control), and it does not provide a method of testing the statistical significance of specific haplotypes. To address these limitations, we developed new methods of testing the statistical association between haplotypes and a wide variety of traits, including binary, ordinal, and quantitative traits. Our methods allow adjustment for nongenetic covariates, which may be critical when analyzing genetically complex traits. Furthermore, our methods provide several different global tests for association, as well as haplotype-specific tests, which give a meaningful advantage in attempts to understand the roles of many different haplotypes. The statistics can be computed rapidly, making it feasible to evaluate the associations between many haplotypes and a trait. To illustrate the use of our new methods, they are applied to a study of the association of haplotypes (composed of genes from the human-leukocyte-antigen complex) with humoral immune response to measles vaccination. Limited simulations are also presented to demonstrate the validity of our methods, as well as to provide guidelines on how our methods could be used.},

	abstract = {Attractor networks, which map an input space to a discrete output space, are useful for pattern completion--cleaning up noisy or missing input features. However, designing a net to have a given set of attractors is notoriously tricky; training procedures are CPU intensive and often produce spurious attractors and ill-conditioned attractor basins. These difficulties occur because each connection in the network participates in the encoding of multiple attractors. We describe an alternative formulation of attractor networks in which the encoding of knowledge is local, not distributed. Although localist attractor networks have similar dynamics to their distributed counterparts, they are much easier to work with and interpret. We propose a statistical formulation of localist attractor net dynamics, which yields a convergence proof and a mathematical interpretation of model parameters. We present simulation experiments that explore the behavior of localist attractor networks, showing that they yield few spurious attractors, and they readily exhibit two desirable properties of psychological and neurobiological models: priming (faster convergence to an attractor if the attractor has been recently visited) and gang effects (in which the presence of an attractor enhances the attractor basins of neighboring attractors).},

	shorttitle = {{VAN}},
	doi = {10.1186/1756-0500-6-430},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale molecular interaction networks are dynamic in nature and are of special interest in the analysis of complex diseases, which are characterized by network-level perturbations rather than changes in individual genes/proteins. The methods developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes or gene sets are not suitable for network-level analyses. Consequently, bioinformatics approaches that enable a joint analysis of high-throughput transcriptomics datasets and large-scale molecular interaction networks for identifying perturbed networks are gaining popularity. Typically, these approaches require the sequential application of multiple bioinformatics techniques - ID mapping, network analysis, and network visualization. Here, we present the Variability Analysis in Networks (VAN) software package: a collection of R functions to streamline this bioinformatics analysis.
FINDINGS: VAN determines whether there are network-level perturbations across biological states of interest. It first identifies hubs (densely connected proteins/microRNAs) in a network and then uses them to extract network modules (comprising of a hub and all its interaction partners). The function identifySignificantHubs identifies dysregulated modules (i.e. modules with changes in expression correlation between a hub and its interaction partners) using a single expression and network dataset. The function summarizeHubData identifies dysregulated modules based on a meta-analysis of multiple expression and/or network datasets. VAN also converts protein identifiers present in a MITAB-formatted interaction network to gene identifiers (UniProt identifier to Entrez identifier or gene symbol using the function generatePpiMap) and generates microRNA-gene interaction networks using TargetScan and Microcosm databases (generateMicroRnaMap). The function obtainCancerInfo is used to identify hubs (corresponding to significantly perturbed modules) that are already causally associated with cancer(s) in the Cancer Gene Census database. Additionally, VAN supports the visualization of changes to network modules in R and Cytoscape (visualizeNetwork and obtainPairSubset, respectively). We demonstrate the utility of VAN using a gene expression data from metastatic melanoma and a protein-protein interaction network from the Human Protein Reference Database.
CONCLUSIONS: Our package provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for the integrative analysis of -omics data to identify disease-associated network modules. This bioinformatics approach, which is essentially focused on the question of explaining phenotype with a 'network type' and in particular, how regulation is changing among different states of interest, is relevant to many questions including those related to network perturbations across developmental timelines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare gene expression profiles between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and undifferentiated spondylarthritis (uSpA) patients with inflammatory low back pain.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with AS, patients with uSpA, and healthy subjects were screened using genome-wide microarrays, followed by validation by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Microarray profiling and real-time PCR assays showed only minor differences between AS patients and healthy subjects. In contrast, 20 genes were strikingly more highly expressed in uSpA patients. Regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) was identified as the most useful biomarker for distinguishing uSpA patients, and to a lesser extent AS patients, from control subjects (P = 2.3 x 10(-7) and 6.7 x 10(-3), respectively). These findings were verified in an independent cohort that also included patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with mechanical low back pain. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values in the first and second cohorts of uSpA patients were 0.99 and 0.93, respectively (P = 1 x 10(-4)). To evaluate the possible derivation of RGS1, we cultured a monocyte-derived cell line with a panel of cytokines and chemokines. RGS1 was significantly induced either by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or by interleukin-17 (IL-17).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that uSpA PBMCs carry strikingly more highly expressed genes compared with PBMCs from AS patients or healthy subjects, and that TNFalpha- and IL-17-inducible RGS1 is a potential biomarker for uSpA, and to a lesser extent for AS, with inflammatory low back pain.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Living cells are the product of gene expression programs that involve the regulated transcription of thousands of genes. The elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks is thus needed to understand the cell's working mechanism, and can for example, be useful for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level.
Results: We propose SIRENE (Supervised Inference of Regulatory Networks), a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each transcription factor. SIRENE is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations in Escherichia coli, and show that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other state-of-the-art inference methods.

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with essential functions in viral genome replication and represents a promising therapeutic target to develop direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Multiple nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) binding sites have been identified within the polymerase. VX-222 and ANA598 are two NNIs targeting thumb II site and palm I site of HCV NS5B polymerase, respectively. These two molecules have been shown to be very effective in phase II clinical trials. However, the emergence of resistant HCV replicon variants (L419M, M423T, I482L mutants to VX-222 and M414T, M414L, G554D mutants to ANA598) has significantly decreased their efficacy. To elucidate the molecular mechanism about how these mutations influenced the drug binding mode and decreased drug efficacy, we studied the binding modes of VX-222 and ANA598 to wild-type and mutant polymerase by molecular modeling approach. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations results combined with binding free energy calculations indicated that the mutations significantly altered the binding free energy and the interaction for the drugs to polymerase. The further per-residue binding free energy decomposition analysis revealed that the mutations decreased the interactions with several key residues, such as L419, M423, L474, S476, I482, L497, for VX-222 and L384, N411, M414, Y415, Q446, S556, G557 for ANA598. These were the major origins for the resistance to these two drugs. In addition, by analyzing the residue interaction network (RIN) of the complexes between the drugs with wild-type and the mutant polymerase, we found that the mutation residues in the networks involved in the drug resistance possessed a relatively lower size of topology centralities. The shift of betweenness and closeness values of binding site residues in the mutant polymerase is relevant to the mechanism of drug resistance of VX-222 and ANA598. These results can provide an atomic-level understanding about the mechanisms of drug resistance conferred by the studied mutations and will be helpful to design more potent inhibitors which could effectively overcome drug resistance of antivirus agents.},

To elucidate such networks, we identify genes targeted by ​CHD8, a chromodomain helicase strongly associated with ASD, in human midfetal brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and embryonic mouse cortex. ​CHD8 targets are strongly enriched for other ASD risk genes in both human and mouse neurodevelopment, and converge in ASD-associated co-expression networks in human midfetal cortex. ​CHD8 knockdown in hNSCs results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes directly targeted by ​CHD8. Integration of ​CHD8-binding data into ASD risk models improves detection of risk genes.

	abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

The main goals of PANTHER remain essentially unchanged: the accurate inference (and practical application) of gene and protein function over large sequence databases, using phylogenetic trees to extrapolate from the relatively sparse experimental information from a few model organisms. Yet the focus of PANTHER has continually shifted toward more accurate and detailed representations of evolutionary events in gene family histories. The trees are now designed to represent gene family evolution, including inference of evolutionary events, such as speciation and gene duplication. Subfamilies are still curated and used to define HMMs, but gene ontology functional annotations can now be made at any node in the tree, and are designed to represent gain and loss of function by ancestral genes during evolution. Finally, PANTHER now includes stable database identifiers for inferred ancestral genes, which are used to associate inferred gene attributes with particular genes in the common ancestral genomes of extant species.},

	abstract = {Given the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the world, the search for genetic variations controlling the levels of risk factors associated with the development of the disease continues. Multiple genetic association studies suggest the involvement of procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-2 (PCPE2) in modulating HDL-C levels. Therefore biochemical and mechanistic studies were undertaken to determine whether there might be a basis for a role of PCPE2 in HDL biogenesis. Our studies indicate that PCPE2 accelerates the proteolytic processing of pro-apolipoprotein (apo) AI by enhancing the cleavage of the hexapeptide extension present at the N terminus of apoAI. Surface Plasmon Resonance and immunoprecipitation studies indicate that PCPE2 interacts with BMP-1 and pro-apoAI to form a ternary pro-apoAI/BMP-1/PCPE2 complex. The most favorable interaction among these proteins begins with the association of BMP-1 to pro-apoAI followed by the binding of PCPE2 which further stabilizes the complex. PCPE2 resides, along with apoAI, on the HDL fraction of lipoproteins in human plasma supporting a relationship between HDL and PCPE2. Taken together, the findings from our studies identify a new player in the regulation of apoAI post-translational processing and open a new avenue to the study of mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoAI synthesis, HDL levels, and potentially, cardiovascular disease.},

It first establishes a sufficient condition for the coincidence of the partial correlation with the conditional correlation. The condition is satisfied not only for multivariate normal but also for elliptical, multivariate hypergeometric, multivariate negative hypergeometric, multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. Such families of distributions are characterized by a semigroup property as a parametric family of distributions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of the partial covariance with the conditional covariance is also derived. However, a known family of multivariate distributions which satisfies this condition cannot be found, except for the multivariate normal. The paper also shows that conditional independence has no close ties with zero partial correlation except in the case of the multivariate normal distribution; it has rather close ties to the zero conditional correlation. It shows that the equivalence between zero conditional covariance and conditional independence for normal variables is retained by any monotone transformation of each variable. The results suggest that care must be taken when using such correlations as measures of conditional independence unless the joint distribution is known to be normal. Otherwise a new concept of conditional independence may need to be introduced in place of conditional independence through zero conditional correlation or other statistics.},

	doi = {10.1186/ar3309},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A number of genetic-association studies have identified genes contributing to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility but such approaches provide little information as to the gene activity changes occurring during the disease process. Transcriptional profiling generates a 'snapshot' of the sampled cells' activity and thus can provide insights into the molecular processes driving the disease process. We undertook a whole-genome microarray approach to identify candidate genes associated with AS and validated these gene-expression changes in a larger sample cohort.
METHODS: A total of 18 active AS patients, classified according to the New York criteria, and 18 gender- and age-matched controls were profiled using Illumina HT-12 whole-genome expression BeadChips which carry cDNAs for 48,000 genes and transcripts. Class comparison analysis identified a number of differentially expressed candidate genes. These candidate genes were then validated in a larger cohort using qPCR-based TaqMan low density arrays (TLDAs).
RESULTS: A total of 239 probes corresponding to 221 genes were identified as being significantly different between patients and controls with a P-value {\textless}0.0005 (80\% confidence level of false discovery rate). Forty-seven genes were then selected for validation studies, using the TLDAs. Thirteen of these genes were validated in the second patient cohort with 12 downregulated 1.3- to 2-fold and only 1 upregulated (1.6-fold). Among a number of identified genes with well-documented inflammatory roles we also validated genes that might be of great interest to the understanding of AS progression such as SPOCK2 (osteonectin) and EP300, which modulate cartilage and bone metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: We have validated a gene expression signature for AS from whole blood and identified strong candidate genes that may play roles in both the inflammatory and joint destruction aspects of the disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a complex inflammatory disorder. We investigated the influence of environmental factors on SpA disease activity.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of adults with SpA was followed for 3 years. Patients logged on to a secured Website every 3 months to complete a questionnaire. They reported whether they had been exposed to environmental factors such as stressful or traumatic life events, infections, or vaccinations. Outcome variables included the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and pain and patient global assessment (PGA) on visual numerical scales (each rated 0-10). Analyses were performed using a generalized estimating equation for repeated measures, adjusted for the outcome variable collected by the previous questionnaire.
RESULTS: In total, 272 patients were included in the analysis, completing the questionnaire on 2240 occasions. The average time (mean ± SD) between 2 connections to the Website was 4.0 ± 2.0 months. Occurrence of life events was followed by an increase of 0.5 (95\% CI 0.4-0.7) in the BASDAI, 0.5 (95\% CI 0.3-0.6) in the BASFI, 0.7 (95\% CI 0.5-0.9) in the PGA, and 0.8 (95\% CI 0.6-1.0) for pain (p {\textless} 0.0001 for all variations). A moderately statistically significant link was found between vaccination and an elevation of the BASDAI of 0.3 (95\% CI 0.0-0.5; p = 0.032). No influence of other factors was detected.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study in a dedicated SpA cohort shows for the first time a link between stressful events and disease activity. Although this link was statistically highly significant, its clinical meaning remains to be determined because the average magnitude of variation of the different variables studied was rather mild.},

METHODS: Mature splenic DCs were isolated from HLA-B27-transgenic, HLA-B7-transgenic, and/or Hubeta2m-transgenic rats and tested for support of allogeneic proliferation, compared with nontransgenic controls (all male rats on Lewis background). Graded numbers of DCs were cultured with allogeneic lymph node CD4+ T cells (dark agouti background). Proliferation was assayed by incorporation of tritiated deoxythymidine after 2-4 days of culture.
RESULTS: Allogeneic proliferation stimulated by DCs from the healthy HLA-B27/Hubeta2m-transgenic line 21-3 and from the healthy Hubeta2m-transgenic line 283-2 was weakly decreased (21-3) or close to normal (283-2) as compared with that observed with control nontransgenic Lewis rat DCs. In contrast, the ability of DCs from (21-3 x 283-2)F1 rats, which develop a dramatic SpA phenotype, to stimulate allogeneic proliferation was markedly defective. When DC-induced allogeneic proliferation was compared among different transgenic lines and crosses with distinct levels of susceptibility to SpA-like disease, stimulatory capacity was inversely correlated with disease susceptibility.
CONCLUSION: In HLA-B27/Hubeta2m-transgenic rats, a defective functional capacity of DCs correlates with susceptibility to SpA. Since it was previously demonstrated that defective DC function is not a consequence of disease, it could well be a principal factor in the spontaneous development of SpA in these lines.},

Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered. In this review, we highlight recent progress on this intimate relationship between gut and joint inflammation. Emerging evidence exists favoring a role for genes beyond human leukocyte antigen B27 in the genetic predisposition of SpA and intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the role of these predisposing genes in modulating host-pathogen interaction at mucosal surfaces and the subsequent link between gut and joint inflammation are of utmost importance in understanding the pathogenesis of SpA.},

In this study, we demonstrate that the absence of Plin2 prevents high-fat diet(HFD)-induced obesity in male and female mice. This response is associated with increased formation of subcutaneous beige adipocyte cells with uncoupling protein 1 expression, and amelioration of inflammatory foci formation in white adipose tissue and steatosis in the liver. Experiments demonstrate that Plin2 loss results in reduced energy intake and increased physical activity in response to HFD feeding.

AECs in monolayer culture and differentiated epithelial cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) represent two distinct and commonly used in vitro models, yet differences in their response to pathogens have not been investigated. In this study, we compared the transcriptional effects of flagellin on AECs in monolayer culture versus ALI culture using whole-genome microarrays and RNA sequencing. We exposed monolayer and ALI AEC cultures to flagellin in vitro and analyzed the transcriptional response by microarray and RNA-sequencing. ELISA and RT-PCR were used to validate changes in select candidates. We found that AECs cultured in monolayer and ALI have strikingly different transcriptional states at baseline. When challenged with flagellin, monolayer AEC cultures greatly increased transcription of numerous genes mapping to wounding response, immunity and inflammatory response. In contrast, AECs in ALI culture had an unexpectedly muted response to flagellin, both in number of genes expressed and relative enrichment of inflammatory and immune pathways. We conclude that in vitro culturing methods have a dramatic effect on the transcriptional profile of AECs at baseline and after stimulation with flagellin. These differences suggest that epithelial responses to pathogen challenges are distinctly different in culture models of intact and injured epithelium.},

Global and dynamic analysis of transcription factors in response to a physiological stimulus has yet to be achieved in a human system, and our efforts significantly advanced this goal. We used multiple global high-throughput technologies for measuring mRNA levels, including massively parallel signature sequencing and GeneChip microarrays. We identified 92 of 1,288 known human transcription factors as having significantly measurable changes during our 24-h time course. At least 42 of these changes were previously unidentified in this system. Our data demonstrate that some transcription factors operate in a functional range below 10 transcripts per cell, whereas others operate in a range three orders of magnitude greater. The highly reproducible response of many mRNAs indicates feedback control. A broad range of activation kinetics was observed; thus, combinatorial regulation by small subsets of transcription factors would permit almost any timing input to cis-regulatory elements controlling gene transcription.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The spondylarthritides (SpA) are strongly associated with possession of HLA-B27. We hypothesized that the expression of abnormal forms of HLA-B27 in SpA may have a pathogenic role through interaction with cells bearing natural killer (NK) receptors, in particular, killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) KIR3DL2, a receptor for HLA-B27 homodimer (B27(2)). We therefore undertook the present study to determine the number and function of NK and T cells bearing KIR3DL2 in SpA.
METHODS: Expression of KIR3DL2 on NK and T cells was quantified in peripheral blood (PB) from 35 patients with SpA and 5 patients with juvenile enthesitis-related arthritis (juvenile ERA); samples were compared with samples from healthy and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) controls. Paired synovial fluid (SF) was studied where available. Expression of other KIRs as well as activation, memory, and homing markers on KIR3DL2+ NK and T cells was quantified. NK cell survival was assessed using the apoptotic markers annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D, and cytotoxicity by (51)Cr release assay.
RESULTS: In SpA, an increased number of PB and SF NK and CD4+ T cells expressed the KIR3DL2 receptor compared with controls. In ERA, KIR3DL2 expression was increased in PB and SF CD4 T cells (and SF NK cells) compared with RA controls. KIR3DL2+ NK cells had an activated phenotype, and were protected from apoptosis by culture with a cell line expressing B27(2). SpA PB mononuclear NK cells from SpA patients showed greater cytotoxicity than those from controls.
CONCLUSION: KIR3DL2 expression on NK cells and CD4 lymphocytes is increased in SpA and ERA. These cells are activated and may have a pathogenic role.},

	abstract = {Introduction
This study aimed to compare the functional capacity and gene expression profile of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DCs) in HLA-B27+ axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients and healthy controls.

Methods
MD-DCs were differentiated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for seven days, starting from purified CD14+ monocytes and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for six and twenty four hours. Their capacity to stimulate allogeneic CD4+ T cells from unrelated healthy donor was tested. Transcriptomic study was performed with Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST microarrays. Gene expression levels were compared between patients and controls using a multivariate design under a linear model (LIMMA). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for validation of the most striking gene expression differences.

Results
The stimulatory capacity of allogeneic CD4+ T cells by MD-DCs from SpA patients was decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 81 genes differentially expressed in MD-DCs between SpA patients and controls (P {\textless}0.01 and fold-change {\textless}0.66 or {\textgreater}1.5). Four selected genes were validated by qRT-PCR: ADAMTS15, CITED2, F13A1 and SELL. Expression levels of ADAMTS15 and CITED2, encoding a metallopeptidase and a transcription factor, respectively, were inversely correlated with each other (R = 0.75, P = 0.0003). Furthermore, in silico analysis identified several genes of the Wnt signaling pathway having expression co-regulated with CITED2.

Conclusion
This study revealed altered function and gene expression pattern in MD-DCs from HLA-B27+ axial SpA. Co-expression study showed an inverse correlation between ADAMTS15 and CITED2. Moreover, the Wnt signaling pathway appeared as deregulated in SpA MD-DCs, a finding which may be connected to Th17-driven inflammatory responses.

However, there is evidence for the involvement of other, non-B27 factors within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in AS susceptibility. MHC class I is clearly the most significant genetic region for the disease, although most of the genetic association of this region is driven by HLA-B27. Moreover, several studies have investigated the MHC class II region and its association with AS. This review summarizes the current findings concerning the MHC genetics of the disease, focusing in particular on the associations of HLA with AS found in different ethnic populations throughout the world, and the possible mechanisms underlying them.},

Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based “eigen-molecules” in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates.

We describe a real-time quantitative PCR assay that uses SYBR Green I dye-based detection and product melting curve analysis to validate differentially expressed genes identified by gene expression profiling technologies. Since SYBR Green I dye is a nonspecific intercalating dye, the reaction is made specific by using "hot-start" PCR and empirically determined annealing and signal acquisition temperatures for each gene-specific primer. Relative expression levels were quantified by constructing a standard curve using cDNA dilutions of a highly expressed gene. Using this approach, real-time PCR validated 17 of 21 (71\%) genes identified by DNA arrays, and all but 1 of 13 (91\%) genes identified by differential display PCR (DD-PCR). Validation of differentially expressed genes detected by array analysis was related to hybridization intensity. Real-time RT-PCR results suggest that genes identified by DNA arrays with a two to fourfold difference in expression cannot be accepted as true or false without validation. Validation of differentially expressed genes detected by DD-PCR was not affected by band intensities. Regardless of the gene expression profiling technology (microarrays, DD-PCR, serial analysis of gene expression and subtraction hybridization), once the sequence of gene of interest is known, the real-time RT-PCR approach is well suited for validation of differential expression since it is quantitative and rapid and requires 1000-fold less RNA than conventional assays.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: En face aorta analysis and aortic root examination showed that ApoE(-/-)Timp3(-/-) mice show increased atherosclerosis with increased infiltration of macrophages into the plaque. Serum concentration of MCP-1 were elevated in the serum of ApoE(-/-)Timp3(-/-) mice coupled with an expansion of the inflammatory (M1) Gr1+ macrophages, both in the circulation and within the aortic tissue. Targeted analysis of metabolites revealed a trend to reduced short chain acylcarnitines.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that lack of TIMP3 increases inflammation and polarizes macrophages towards a more inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased atherosclerosis.},

Disturbance of this homeostasis causes ER stress and activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The Ufm1 conjugation system is a novel Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) system whose physiological target(s) and biological functions remain largely undefined. Genetic study has demonstrated that the Ufm1-activating enzyme Uba5 is indispensible for erythroid differentiation in mice, highlighting the importance of this novel system in animal development. In this report we present the evidence for involvement of RCAD/Ufl1, a putative Ufm1-specific E3 ligase, and its binding partner C53/LZAP protein in ufmylation of endogenous Ufm1 targets. Moreover, we found that the Ufm1 system was transcriptionally up-regulated by disturbance of the ER homeostasis and inhibition of vesicle trafficking. Using luciferase reporter and ChIP assays, we dissected the Ufm1 promoter and found that Ufm1 was a potential target of Xbp-1, one of crucial transcription factors in UPR. We further examined the effect of Xbp-1 deficiency on the expression of the Ufm1 components. Interestingly, the expression of Ufm1, Uba5, RCAD/Ufl1 and C53/LZAP in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was significantly induced by inhibition of vesicle trafficking, but the induction was negated by Xbp-1 deficiency. Finally, we found that knockdown of the Ufm1 system in U2OS cells triggered UPR and amplification of the ER network. Taken together, our study provided critical insight into the regulatory mechanism of the Ufm1 system and established a direct link between this novel Ubl system and the ER network.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the reduced capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) from HLA-B27-transgenic rats to form conjugates with naive T cells.
METHODS: We monitored interactions between DCs derived from HLA-B27-transgenic, HLA-B7-transgenic control, and nontransgenic rats and naive CD4+ T cells. Chemoattraction was studied in Transwell assays, and the formation of an immunologic synapse was examined by videomicroscopy and electron microscopy. Involvement of specific molecules in the defective interaction was examined in antibody-blocking assays.
RESULTS: T cells migrated normally toward B27 DCs, but upon contact, the frequency of T cells undergoing a Ca2+ response was decreased, indicating impaired immunologic synapse formation. The immunologic synapse formed between B27 DCs and T cells appeared to be normal, as assessed by electron microscopy and by the Ca2+ response. Blocking lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 on T cells or blocking activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules on DCs inhibited an equivalent proportion of conjugates from forming between B27 or control DCs and T cells, whereas blocking CD86 on DCs and blocking CD28, CD2, or CD4 on T cells inhibited a greater number of conjugates from forming with control DCs, indicating specific involvement of costimulatory molecules in the reduced formation of conjugates with B27 DCs. Mature B27 molecules on the DC surface were responsible for this decreased formation of conjugates.
CONCLUSION: In the HLA-B27-transgenic rat model of spondylarthropathy, mature B27 molecules expressed by DCs impair the formation of an antigen-independent immunologic synapse with naive CD4+ T cells by interfering with the engagement of costimulatory molecules. This phenomenon could potentially affect the production and/or maintenance of regulatory T cells and contribute to the expansion of pathogenic CD4+ T cells.},

Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable., Results: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us., Availability: Our robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a freely available software package, KING, available for download at http://people.virginia.edu/∼wc9c/KING., Contact: wmchen@virginia.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

METHODS: Monocyte protein expression was characterised by 2D gel electrophoresis and by label-free quantitative expression profiling, using nano-ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS(E), where (E) refers to low/high collision energy switching). Data sets were analysed using the Waters expression profiling system and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).
RESULTS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed upregulation of proteasomal constituents in AS monocytes, including the beta subunit of proteasome activator (PA)28. Monocyte expression profiling and IPA showed that significant changes in protein expression within the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) were restricted to AS monocytes. Statistically significant differences in protein expression involving the leucocyte extravasation, vascular endothelial growth factor, integrin and Toll-like receptor signalling pathways were seen in AS and RA monocytes compared to healthy controls. No evidence of upregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway was found in either AS or RA monocytes. Finally, the PA28 complex was shown to increase the generation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 antigenic epitopes by the proteasome in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomic analyses support the hypothesis that monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of AS and RA, and further suggest a specific role in AS for the UPP. Quantitative proteomic expression profiling constitutes a powerful new tool for rheumatology research.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Assessing functional associations between an experimentally derived gene or protein set of interest and a database of known gene/protein sets is a common task in the analysis of large-scale functional genomics data. For this purpose, a frequently used approach is to apply an over-representation-based enrichment analysis. However, this approach has four drawbacks: (i) it can only score functional associations of overlapping gene/proteins sets; (ii) it disregards genes with missing annotations; (iii) it does not take into account the network structure of physical interactions between the gene/protein sets of interest and (iv) tissue-specific gene/protein set associations cannot be recognized.
RESULTS: To address these limitations, we introduce an integrative analysis approach and web-application called EnrichNet. It combines a novel graph-based statistic with an interactive sub-network visualization to accomplish two complementary goals: improving the prioritization of putative functional gene/protein set associations by exploiting information from molecular interaction networks and tissue-specific gene expression data and enabling a direct biological interpretation of the results. By using the approach to analyse sets of genes with known involvement in human diseases, new pathway associations are identified, reflecting a dense sub-network of interactions between their corresponding proteins.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage regeneration is hampered by lack of knowledge about the underlying molecular differences between chondrogenically stimulated chondrocytes and MSCs. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in phenotype and gene expression between primary human chondrocytes and MSCs during chondrogenic differentiation in three-dimensional (3D) pellet culture (PC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chondrocytes isolated from cartilage samples obtained during total knee alloarthroplastic procedure (N=8) and MSCs, purified from bone marrow aspirates of healthy donors (N=8), were cultivated in PC under chondrogenic conditions. Immunohistology and quantitative reverse transcribing PCR (RT-PCR) were performed for chondrogenic-specific markers (i.e., Sox9, Collagen II). Global gene expression of the so-cultivated chondrocytes and MSCs was assessed by a novel approach of microarray-based pathway analysis. Refinement of data was done by hypothesis-driven gene expression omnibus (GEO) dataset comparison. Validation was performed with separate samples in transforming growth factor (TGF)β+ or TGFβ- conditions by use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Chondrogenic commitment of both cell types was observed. Interestingly, chondrocytes demonstrated an upregulated fatty acid/cholesterol metabolism which may give hints for future optimization of culture conditions. The novel microarray-based pathway analysis applied in this study seems suitable for the evaluation of whole-genome based array datasets in case when hypotheses can be backed with already existing GEO datasets. Future experiments should further explore the different metabolic behaviour of chondrocytes and MSC.},

In this study, we demonstrate that the absence of Plin2 prevents high-fat diet(HFD)-induced obesity in male and female mice. This response is associated with increased formation of subcutaneous beige adipocyte cells with uncoupling protein 1 expression, and amelioration of inflammatory foci formation in white adipose tissue and steatosis in the liver. Experiments demonstrate that Plin2 loss results in reduced energy intake and increased physical activity in response to HFD feeding.

	abstract = {Lymphocyte infiltration into epithelial tissues and proinflammatory cytokine release are key steps in autoimmune disease. Although cell-autonomous roles of lymphocytes are well studied in autoimmunity, much less is understood about the stromal factors that dictate immune cell function. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) controls systemic cytokine bioavailability and signaling by inhibiting the ectodomain shedding of cytokines and their receptors. The role of TIMP3 in cytokine biology is emerging; however, its contribution to cellular immunology remains unknown. In this study, we show that TIMP3 produced by the hepatic stroma regulates the basal lymphocyte populations in the liver and prevents autoimmune hepatitis. TIMP3 deficiency in mice led to spontaneous accumulation and activation of hepatic CD4(+), CD8(+), and NKT cells. Treatment with Con A in a model of polyclonal T lymphocyte activation resulted in a greatly enhanced Th1 cytokine response and acute liver failure, which mechanistically depended on TNF signaling. Bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that TIMP3 derived from the stromal rather than hematopoietic compartment provided protection against autoimmunity. Finally, we identified hepatocytes as the major source of Timp3 in a resting liver, whereas significant Timp3 gene transcription was induced by hepatic stellate cells in the inflamed liver. These results uncover metalloproteinase inhibitors as critical stromal factors in regulating cellular immunity during autoimmune hepatitis.},

It commonly presents as chronic axial and/or peripheral arthritis with potential disabling outcome. SpA is also variably associated with extra-articular manifestations. The pathogenesis of SpA is considered as complex, with a strong genetic component. Human leukocyte antigen B27 has been identified as a predisposing factor for SpA, but family and twin studies suggest that additional genetic risk factors exist outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To map SpA susceptibility loci, 120 multiplex SpA families were included in a genome-wide scan. Linkage analyses performed on the first 65 families allowed us to identify four candidate non-MHC regions on chromosomes 5q, 9q, 13q and 17q, which were further explored in the remaining 55 multiplex families (extension study). Non-parametric multipoint linkage analyses of the whole data set yielded evidence of significant linkage to 9q31-34, in the vicinity of marker D9S1776 (NPL=4.87, LOD=5.15, P=0.00002).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A primary defect of the tight junctions and, hence, increased intestinal epithelial permeability has been proposed as a basic pathogenic event in Crohn's disease. Challenge of the mucosal immune system by the commensal gut flora would then result in chronic inflammation. Alternatively, increased permeability could be the result of inflammation. Our aim was to study intestinal permeability in refractory Crohn's disease before and after treatment with monoclonal chimeric antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to investigate whether the abnormal permeability persists after control of inflammation.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were evaluated before and 4 wk after a single infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Intestinal permeability was studied by measurement of urinary excretion of 51Cr-EDTA after oral intake.
RESULTS: The increased permeation of 51Cr-EDTA through the small intestine (1.63\% interquartile range [IQR] 1.06-2.07) and the overall permeation (3.27\% IQR 2.40-4.38) before therapy decreased significantly after infliximab infusion to values (1.04\% IQR 0.74-1.54 and 2.42\% IQR 2.03-2.80, respectively) in the range of those found in normal volunteers (1.12\% IQR 0.85-1.58 and 2.28\% IQR 1.88-2.86, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor dramatically reduces gut inflammation and largely restores the gut barrier in Crohn's disease. Our data confirm the central role of TNF in gut barrier modulation in inflammatory conditions in vivo.},

Cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Cytokines are therefore attractive therapeutic targets in these conditions.

Although these therapies have transformed the treatment of patients with severe inflammatory arthritis, there remain significant limiting factors: treatment failure is commonly seen in the clinic; safety concerns remain; there is uncertainty regarding the relevance of immunogenicity; the absence of biomarkers to direct therapy decisions and high drug costs limit availability in some healthcare systems. In this article, we provide an overview of the key efficacy and safety trials for currently approved treatments in rheumatoid arthritis and review the major lessons learned from a decade of use in clinical practice, focusing mainly on anti-TNF and anti-interleukin (IL)-6 agents.

The disease-prone lines showed higher expression of B27--thymic mRNA in utero, splenic mRNA by 5 days of age, and splenic cell surface protein by the time of disease onset--than the disease-resistant lines. Disease susceptibility thus appeared to correlate with gene copy number and the quantity of B27 in lymphoid cells. The increase in the amount of B27 protein did not appear to be simply a consequence of the inflammatory disease because 1) there was no similar change in endogenous RT1 class I expression; 2) no alteration of B27 expression occurred in 21-4H rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis; 3) in rats with inflammatory disease transgenic for HLA-A2 and the 21-4H transgene locus, A2 expression was the same as in healthy rats transgenic for A2 but not B27; and 4) the transgenes in disease-prone and disease-resistant lines were equally susceptible to induction by IFN-gamma. Immunocytochemistry of the distal colon, an early site of inflammation, showed that the B27 Ag is expressed at high levels in cells of the lamina propria, but not at all in colonic epithelial cells. Taken together, the data suggest that the B27 transgene is expressed in a copy number dependent, position-independent manner in lymphoid tissue and that disease results from the expression of B27 above a critical threshold level.},

BACKGROUND: The main symptom of AS is inflammatory spinal pain; with time, some patients develop ankylosis and spinal immobility. We aim to find cure available for ankylosing spondylitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the GSE11886 series to identify potential genes that related to AS to construct a regulation network.
RESULTS: In the network, some of TFs and target genes have been proved related with AS in previous study, such as NFKB1, STAT1, STAT4, TNFSF10, IL2RA, and IL2RB. We also found some new TFs (Franscription Factors) and target genes response to AS, such as BXDC5, and EGFR. Further analysis indicated some significant pathways are associated with AS, including antigen processing and presentation and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, etc.; although not significant, there was evident that they play an important role in AS progression, such as apoptosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, it is demonstrated that transcriptome network analysis is useful in identification of the candidate genes in AS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intestinal inflammation is a common feature of spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and Crohn's disease. Inflammation is manifested clinically in Crohn's disease and subclinically in SpA. However, a fraction of patients with SpA develops overt Crohn's disease.
AIMS: To investigate whether subclinical gut lesions in patients with SpA are associated with transcriptome changes comparable to those seen in Crohn's disease and to examine global gene expression in non-inflamed colon biopsy specimens and screen patients for differentially expressed genes.
METHODS: Macroarray analysis was used as an initial genomewide screen for selecting a comprehensive set of genes relevant to Crohn's disease and SpA. This led to the identification of 2625 expressed sequence tags that are differentially expressed in the colon of patients with Crohn's disease or SpA. These clones, with appropriate controls (6779 in total), were used to construct a glass-based microarray, which was then used to analyse colon biopsy specimens from 15 patients with SpA, 11 patients with Crohn's disease and 10 controls.
RESULTS: 95 genes were identified as differentially expressed in patients with SpA having a history of subclinical chronic gut inflammation and also in patients with Crohn's disease. Principal component analysis of this filtered set of genes successfully distinguished colon biopsy specimens from the three groups studied. Patients with SpA having subclinical chronic gut inflammation cluster together and are more related to those with Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSION: The transcriptome in the intestine of patients with SpA differs from that of controls. Moreover, these gene changes are comparable to those seen in patients with Crohn's disease, confirming initial clinical observations. On the basis of these findings, new (genetic) markers for detection of early Crohn's disease in patients with SpA can be considered.},

	abstract = {Classification criteria for most of the disorders belonging to the spondylarthropathy group already exist. However, the spectrum of spondylarthropathy is wider than the sum of these disorders suggests. Seronegative oligoarthritis, dactylitis or polyarthritis of the lower extremities, heel pain due to enthesitis, and other undifferentiated cases of spondylarthropathy have been ignored in epidemiologic studies because of the inadequacy of existing criteria. In order to define classification criteria that also encompass patients with undifferentiated spondylarthropathy, we studied 403 patients with all forms of spondylarthropathy and 674 control patients with other rheumatic diseases. The diagnoses were based on the local clinical expert's opinion. The 403 patients included 168 with ankylosing spondylitis, 68 with psoriatic arthritis, 41 with reactive arthritis, 17 with inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis, and 109 with unclassified spondylarthropathy. Based on statistical analysis and clinical reasoning, we propose the following classification criteria for spondylarthropathy: inflammatory spinal pain or synovitis (asymmetric or predominantly in the lower limbs), together with at least 1 of the following: positive family history, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, urethritis, or acute diarrhea, alternating buttock pain, enthesopathy, or sacroiliitis as determined from radiography of the pelvic region. These criteria resulted in a sensitivity of 87\% and a specificity of 87\%. The proposed classification criteria are easy to apply in clinical practice and performed well in all 7 participating centers. However, we regard them as preliminary until they have been further evaluated in other settings.},

	doi = {10.1002/art.30377},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our group previously identified a new susceptibility region linked to spondylarthritis (SpA) on chromosome 9q31-34. Fine mapping of this SPA2 locus allowed us to refine the peak of linkage to a 1.3-Mb interval. The objective of this study was to resequence most positional candidate genes lying in that region, to identify polymorphisms, and to examine their association with SpA.
METHODS: Variants screening was performed in 30 independent patients with SpA from families with a high linkage score to the SPA2 locus and 30 control subjects. The coding regions, intron-exon boundaries, and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of ZNF618, A1L4R1\_HUMAN (AF495724), AMBP, KIF12, ORM1, ORM2, C9ORF91, ENSESTG000000230601, and TNFSF8 were resequenced to identify polymorphisms. Selected variants were genotyped in an extended French cohort (442 patients and 268 control subjects overall). Replication was performed in a combined Belgian and Portuguese cohort (433 patients and 299 control subjects).
RESULTS: Variants screening allowed us to identify 98 polymorphisms, 5 of which were selected for further studies, based on statistical significance. The rare intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3181357, located in TNFSF8, was significantly associated with SpA in the French and the replication cohorts (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, P = 0.009 and OR 2.26, P = 0.0014, respectively) and in the pooled analysis (OR 2.14, P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Positional candidate gene screening in the SPA2 locus allowed us to identify and replicate an association between a rare SNP located in TNFSF8 and SpA. This new finding appears to be independent of an association with a haplotype near TNFSF15, which we recently reported.},

Our results showed ectopic expression of RUNX3 in prostate cancer tissues when compared with tumor adjacent normal prostate tissues, and reduced RUNX3 staining was significantly correlated with TNM stage. Moreover, we demonstrated that RUNX3 overexpression inhibited prostate cancer cell migration and invasion resulting from the elevated upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), which subsequently inhibited metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity in vitro. Knock down of RUNX3 expression broke up the balance of TIMP-2/MMP-2, whereas silence of TIMP-2 resulted in the inhibition of MMP-2 expression in prostate cells. We also showed that restoration of RUNX3 decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and suppressed endothelial cell growth and tube formation. Strikingly, RUNX3 was demonstrated to inhibit tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. Altogether, our results support the tumor suppressive role of RUNX3 in human prostate cancer, and provide insights into development of targeted therapy for this disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether macrophages, a type of cell implicated in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), exhibit a characteristic gene expression pattern.
METHODS: Macrophages were derived from the peripheral blood of 8 AS patients (median disease duration 13 years [range {\textless}1-43 years]) and 9 healthy control subjects over 7 days with the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Cells were stimulated for 24 hours with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma; 100 units/ml), were left untreated for 24 hours, or were treated for 3 hours with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 ng/ml). RNA was isolated and examined by microarray and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed 198 probe sets detecting the differential expression of 141 unique genes in untreated macrophages from AS patients compared with healthy controls. Clustering and principal components analysis clearly distinguished AS patients and controls. Of the differentially expressed genes, 78 (55\%) were IFN-regulated, and their relative expression indicated a "reverse" IFN signature in AS patient macrophages, where IFN gamma-up-regulated genes were underexpressed and down-regulated genes were overexpressed. Treatment of macrophages with exogenous IFN gamma normalized the expression of these genes between patients and controls. In addition, the messenger RNA encoded by the IFN gamma gene was approximately 2-fold lower in AS patient macrophages at baseline (P = 0.004) and was poorly responsive to LPS (P = 0.018), as compared with healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal consistent differences in gene expression in macrophages from AS patients, with evidence of a striking "reverse" IFN signature. Together with poor expression and responsiveness of the IFN gamma gene, these results suggest that there may be a relative defect in IFN gamma gene regulation, with autocrine consequences and implications for disease pathogenesis.},

Other transgenic lines that express lower levels of B27 and h beta 2m remain healthy. To investigate the cellular basis for the multisystem inflammatory disease in these rats, we transferred lymphoid cell populations from disease-prone transgenic lines to irradiated disease- resistant transgenic and nontransgenic recipients. In recipients of cells from two different disease-prone lines, successful transfer required engraftment of bone marrow cells. Transfer of disease with fetal liver cells suggested that neither mature effector cells nor active disease in the donors was necessary for induction of disease in the recipients. Remission of the spontaneous disease in irradiated transgenic rats was induced by engraftment of nontransgenic bone marrow. These results suggest that the expression of HLA-B27 in bone marrow-derived cells alone is sufficient for the development of B27- associated disease, and that disease transfer requires engraftment of a bone marrow precursor cell for which mature cells in spleen or in lymph node cannot substitute.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate and refine two sets of candidate criteria for the classification/diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: All Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) members were invited to include consecutively new patients with chronic ({\textgreater} or =3 months) back pain of unknown origin that began before 45 years of age. The candidate criteria were first tested in the entire cohort of 649 patients from 25 centres, and then refined in a random selection of 40\% of cases and thereafter validated in the remaining 60\%.
RESULTS: Upon diagnostic work-up, axial SpA was diagnosed in 60.2\% of the cohort. Of these, 70\% did not fulfil modified New York criteria and, therefore, were classified as having "non-radiographic" axial SpA. Refinement of the candidate criteria resulted in new ASAS classification criteria that are defined as: the presence of sacroiliitis by radiography or by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plus at least one SpA feature ("imaging arm") or the presence of HLA-B27 plus at least two SpA features ("clinical arm"). The sensitivity and specificity of the entire set of the new criteria were 82.9\% and 84.4\%, and for the imaging arm alone 66.2\% and 97.3\%, respectively. The specificity of the new criteria was much better than that of the European Spondylarthropathy Study Group criteria modified for MRI (sensitivity 85.1\%, specificity 65.1\%) and slightly better than that of the modified Amor criteria (sensitivity 82.9, specificity 77.5\%).
CONCLUSION: The new ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA can reliably classify patients for clinical studies and may help rheumatologists in clinical practice in diagnosing axial SpA in those with chronic back pain.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to identify differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) relative to healthy controls and controls with systemic inflammation.
METHODS: we investigated PBC samples of 16 patients with AS and 14 matched controls, in addition to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) samples utilizing Illumina Human Ref-8 BeadChips. Candidate genes were confirmed using quantitative PCR. Subsequently, these genes were also validated in a separate sample of 27 patients with AS [before and after anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment] and 27 matched controls.
RESULTS: we identified 83 differentially expressed transcripts between AS patients and controls. This gene list was filtered through the lists of differentially expressed transcripts in SLE and SSc, which resulted in identification of 52 uniquely dysregulated transcripts in AS. Many of the differentially expressed genes belonged to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and related pathways. TLR4 and TLR5 were the only dysregulated TLR subtypes among AS patients. We confirmed the overexpression of TLR4 and TLR5 in AS patients in comparison to controls (p = 0.012 and p = 0.006, respectively) and SLE (p = 0.002, p = 0.008) using quantitative PCR in the same sample. Similarly, TLR4 (p = 0.007) and TLR5 (p = 0.012) were significantly upregulated among the AS patients before anti-TNF treatment in the confirmatory sample. TLR4 (p = 0.002) and TLR5 (p = 0.025) decreased significantly after anti-TNF treatment.
CONCLUSION: PBC gene expression profiling in AS shows an upregulation of TLR4 and TLR5. This supports the importance of TLR subtypes in the pathogenesis of AS that are responsible for the immune response to Gram-negative bacteria.},

METHODS: Gene expression changes were screened by microarray on peripheral blood RNA of 16 AS patients at baseline and 2 weeks post-infliximab, and selected results were confirmed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. Corresponding serum-soluble LIGHT (sLIGHT) was estimated by ELISA and the fold change in sLIGHT was correlated to the fold change in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the Bath AS disease activity index.
RESULTS: Post-infliximab, 69\% of the patients (11/16) achieved an ASAS20 response. Six candidate genes were differentially expressed by microarray; four of which were validated by qRT-PCR. sLIGHT showed the most significant difference. There was good correlation of baseline sLIGHT with CRP (R = 0.60; p = 0.01) and ESR (R = 0.51; p = 0.04). The fold change in sLIGHT correlated with change in both CRP (R = 0.71, p = 0.002) and ESR (R = 0.77, p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: LIGHT is significantly downregulated by infliximab. sLIGHT correlated well with changes in inflammatory markers.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {A major focus of brain research recently has been to map the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) network architecture of the normal brain and pathology through functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, the phenomenon of anticorrelations in resting-state signals between different brain regions has not been adequately examined. The preponderance of studies on resting-state fMRI (rsFMRI) have either ignored anticorrelations in rsFC networks or adopted methods in data analysis, which have rendered anticorrelations in rsFC networks uninterpretable. The few studies that have examined anticorrelations in rsFC networks using conventional methods have found anticorrelations to be weak in strength and not very reproducible across subjects. Anticorrelations in rsFC network architecture could reflect mechanisms that subserve a number of important brain processes. In this preliminary study, we examined the properties of anticorrelated rsFC networks by systematically focusing on negative cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) among rsFMRI voxel time series across the brain with graph theory-based network analysis. A number of methods were implemented to enhance the neuronal specificity of resting-state functional connections that yield negative CCs, although at the cost of decreased sensitivity. Hubs of anticorrelation were seen in a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions. Examination of the anticorrelation maps of these hubs indicated that negative CCs in rsFC network architecture highlight a number of regulatory interactions between brain networks and regions, including reciprocal modulations, suppression, inhibition, and neurofeedback.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare gene expression profiles between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and undifferentiated spondylarthritis (uSpA) patients with inflammatory low back pain.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with AS, patients with uSpA, and healthy subjects were screened using genome-wide microarrays, followed by validation by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: Microarray profiling and real-time PCR assays showed only minor differences between AS patients and healthy subjects. In contrast, 20 genes were strikingly more highly expressed in uSpA patients. Regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) was identified as the most useful biomarker for distinguishing uSpA patients, and to a lesser extent AS patients, from control subjects (P = 2.3 x 10(-7) and 6.7 x 10(-3), respectively). These findings were verified in an independent cohort that also included patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with mechanical low back pain. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values in the first and second cohorts of uSpA patients were 0.99 and 0.93, respectively (P = 1 x 10(-4)). To evaluate the possible derivation of RGS1, we cultured a monocyte-derived cell line with a panel of cytokines and chemokines. RGS1 was significantly induced either by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or by interleukin-17 (IL-17).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that uSpA PBMCs carry strikingly more highly expressed genes compared with PBMCs from AS patients or healthy subjects, and that TNFalpha- and IL-17-inducible RGS1 is a potential biomarker for uSpA, and to a lesser extent for AS, with inflammatory low back pain.},

Leveraging the existence of disease specific gene sets in KEGG and Metacore® databases, we compared the performance of sixteen methods under relaxed assumptions while using 42 real datasets (over 1,400 samples). Most of the methods ranked high the gene sets designed for specific diseases whenever samples from affected individuals were compared against controls via microarrays. The top methods for gene set prioritization were different from the top ones in terms of sensitivity, and four of the sixteen methods had large false positives rates assessed by permuting the phenotype of the samples. The best overall methods among those that generated reasonably low false positive rates, when permuting phenotypes, were PLAGE, GLOBALTEST, and PADOG.

Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms.

	abstract = {In the thirty years since the initial discovery of a striking association between HLA-B27 and susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis, numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the role of this molecule in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies. In the past few years the focus has shifted from one centered largely on the physiological peptide-presenting function of HLA-B27, to include ideas based on aberrant aspects of its immunobiology. This has been driven in part by results from animal models of HLA-B27-associated disease where CD8+ T cells do not appear to be playing a major role in pathogenesis. In addition, the HLA-B27 heavy chain is unusual in that it has a tendency to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum and to form disulfide linked heavy chain dimers that can be expressed on the cell surface. Although the data suggest misfolding and cell surface dimerization are fundamentally different processes, it appears that certain structural features of the heavy chain are common to both. Potential links between these aberrant characteristics of HLA-B27 and inflammatory disease are discussed in this and other reviews in this issue. Herein we consider how protein misfolding affects cell function through the activation of an 'unfolded protein response' and/or an 'ER overload response', and the potential impact on the immune system. Despite significant advances in the treatment of spondyloarthropathies over the past few years, a better understanding of pathogenesis is likely to improve outcome by identifying ways to provide greater and more sustained clinical responses.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Disease status, in terms of disease activity, disease progression and prognosis is difficult to define in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). No gold standard exists. Therefore, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), a self-administered instrument, has been developed as a new approach to defining disease activity in patients with AS.
METHODS: The index, designed by a multidisciplinary team with input from patients, consists of six 10 cm horizontal visual analog scales to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness (both qualitative and quantitative). The final BASDAI score has a range of 0 to 10. The index was distributed to a cross section of patients, including inpatients receiving 3 weeks of intensive physiotherapy treatment and hospital outpatients. BASDAI was completed by a total of 154 patients. Validation of the new instrument was achieved through analysis of user friendliness, reliability (consistency), score distribution and sensitivity to change. Comparisons were made with a previous Bath disease activity index (DAI) and the Newcastle Enthesis Index.
RESULTS: The BASDAI was found by patients to be quick and simple to complete (mean: 67 s). Test-retest reliability was good (r = 0.93; p {\textless} 0.001), as was the distribution of scores across the scale (score range: 0.5-10; mean: 4.31). BASDAI was sensitive to change, reflecting a 16\% (mean) improvement in inpatient scores after 3 weeks of treatment. It is superior to the DAI in terms of construct and content validity and to the Enthesis Index in all aspects.
CONCLUSION: In summary, BASDAI is user friendly, reliability, sensitive to change and reflects the entire spectrum of disease. It is a comprehensive self-administered instrument for assessing disease activity in AS.},

The quality of the data obtained with this technology varies from experiment to experiment, and an efficient method for quality assessment is necessary to ensure their reliability.
RESULTS: The lack of a good benchmark has hampered evaluation of existing methods for quality control. In this study, we propose a new independent quality metric that is based on evolutionary conservation of expression profiles. We show, using 11 large organ-specific datasets, that IQRray, a new quality metrics developed by us, exhibits the highest correlation with this reference metric, among 14 metrics tested. IQRray outperforms other methods in identification of poor quality arrays in datasets composed of arrays from many independent experiments. In contrast, the performance of methods designed for detecting outliers in a single experiment like Normalized Unscaled Standard Error and Relative Log Expression was low because of the inability of these methods to detect datasets containing only low-quality arrays and because the scores cannot be directly compared between experiments.

	volume = {59},
	issn = {0003-4967},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It has long been suspected that susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is influenced by genes lying distant to the major histocompatibility complex. This study compares genetic models of AS to assess the most likely mode of inheritance, using recurrence risk ratios in relatives of affected subjects.
METHODS: Recurrence risk ratios in different degrees of relatives were determined using published data from studies specifically designed to address the question. The methods of Risch were used to determine the expected recurrence risk ratios in different degrees of relatives, assuming equal first degree relative recurrence risk between models. Goodness of fit was determined by chi(2) comparison of the expected number of affected subjects with the observed number, given equal numbers of each type of relative studied.
RESULTS: The recurrence risks in different degrees of relatives were: monozygotic (MZ) twins 63\% (17/27), first degree relatives 8.2\% (441/5390), second degree relatives 1.0\% (8/834), and third degree relatives 0. 7\% (7/997). Parent-child recurrence risk (7.9\%, 37/466) was not significantly different from the sibling recurrence risk (8.2\%, 404/4924), excluding a significant dominance genetic component to susceptibility. Poor fitting models included single gene, genetic heterogeneity, additive, two locus multiplicative, and one locus and residual polygenes (chi(2) {\textgreater}32 (two degrees of freedom), p{\textless}10(-6) for all models). The best fitting model studied was a five locus model with multiplicative interaction between loci (chi(2)=1.4 (two degrees of freedom), p=0.5). Oligogenic multiplicative models were the best fitting over a range of population prevalences and first degree recurrence risk rates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that of the genetic models tested, the most likely model operating in AS is an oligogenic model with predominantly multiplicative interaction between loci.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vivo effect of an imbalance between metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), in mouse articular cartilage.
METHODS: Hind joints of Timp3(-/-) and wild-type mice were examined by routine staining and by immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific for type X collagen and for the neoepitopes produced on proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan (... VDIPEN and ... NVTEGE) and type II collagen. The neoepitope generated on cleavage of type II collagen by collagenases was quantitated in sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Articular cartilage from Timp3-knockout animals (ages {\textgreater} or =6 months) showed reduced Safranin O staining and an increase in ...VDIPEN content compared with cartilage from heterozygous and wild-type animals. There was also a slight increase in ... NVTEGE content in articular cartilage and menisci of Timp3(-/-) animals. Chondrocytes showed strong pericellular staining for type II collagen cleavage neoepitopes, particularly in the superficial layer, in knockout mice. Also, there was more type X collagen expression in the superficial zone of articular cartilage, especially around clusters of proliferating chondrocytes, in the knockout mice. More type II collagen cleavage product was found in the serum of Timp3(-/-) mice compared with wild-type animals. This increase was significant in 15-month-old animals.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that TIMP-3 deficiency results in mild cartilage degradation similar to changes seen in patients with osteoarthritis, suggesting that an imbalance between metalloproteinases and TIMP-3 may play a pathophysiologic role in the development of this disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spondyloarthropathies (SpAs) are a group of interrelated inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical features. Current SpA treatments only provide partial symptomatic and functional relief in a subgroup of patients. Consequently, there is a need to better understand the pathophysiology of SpA to develop more specific and effective treatments for these conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic and mechanistic evidence links SpA with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis, and the symptoms of these diseases partially overlap. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and dendritic cells control the adaptive immune response, and failures in their functions are likely to contribute to the establishment of chronic inflammation. The contributions of Tregs and dendritic cells to IBD and SpA have been assessed in both animal models of disease and patients.
SUMMARY: Although defects in Tregs are important in psoriasis and in animal models of IBD, there is little evidence that they are important in SpA. However, data from animal models indicate that dendritic cells drive pathogenic T-cell responses, partly through the production of interleukin-23 (IL-23). Dendritic cells from SpA patients may also contribute to disease by producing IL-23, therefore supporting the differentiation of the Th17 cells that contribute to inflammation. The driving forces in SpA pathophysiology are now becoming clear; these data may lead to the development of novel therapies to target SpA and related inflammatory disorders.},

In the context of an ongoing research program aiming at the elucidation of the functional consequences of HMGIC translocations in the etiology of lipomas, we have isolated a novel human gene, LHFP (lipoma HMGIC fusion partner), that acts as a translocation partner of HMGIC in a lipoma with t(12;13). The LHFP gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 13, a region recurrently targeted by chromosomal aberrations in lipomas. By Northern blot analysis, a transcript of 2. 4 kb was detected in a variety of human tissues. We assembled a cDNA contig containing the entire coding region of LHFP. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the composite LHFP cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 200 amino acids. The predicted human LHFP protein is almost identical to a translated mouse EST that covers almost the entire LHFP coding region. In addition, BLAST searches revealed that the LHFP protein belongs to a new protein family consisting of at least four or five members. In the lipoma studied, the expressed HMGIC/LHFP fusion transcript encodes the three DNA binding domains of HMGIC followed by 69 amino acids encoded by frame-shifted LHFP sequences. LHFP is the second translocation partner of HMGIC identified in lipomas and represents a candidate target gene for lipomas with 13q aberrations.},

METHODS: In the pooled cohort of participants in the IDEAL, TNT, and CARDS trials, 50 had ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 36 had psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 21,641 did not have AS or PsA (non-SpA). We compared lipid levels at baseline between AS or PsA and non-SpA, and hazard ratios (HR) for CVD were calculated in a Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: Atherogenic lipids were lower in samples from AS, but not in PsA, compared to non-SpA. The HR for 1 SD increase in baseline lipids for future CVD was for total cholesterol 1.39 (95\% CI 0.82, 2.36) in AS, 1.01 (95\% CI 0.44, 2.31) in PsA, and 1.10 (95\% CI 1.07, 1.14) in non-SpA. Both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein (ApoA-1) were significantly associated with CVD in AS (HR 3.67, 95\% CI 1.47, 9.06, and HR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.02, 3.54, respectively), in contrast to PsA (HDL: HR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.49, 2.15; ApoA-1: HR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.34, 1.89) and non-SpA (HDL: HR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.84, 0.89; ApoA-1: HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.85, 0.91).

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Reiter's syndrome (RS) both show a strong correlation with the HLA B27 haplotype. We studied whether sharing of homologous amino acid sequences in the HLA B27 antigen with an invading microbe might occur, and if so, what is the biological significance of such homology. In a computer search of the Dayhoff data bank, we found a homology of six consecutive amino acids between HLA B27.1 antigen residues 72-77 and Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase residues 188-193. These shared sequences are hydrophilic, suggesting locations on molecules exposed to the cell surface. Immunochemical analysis showed that 18 of 34 sera from patients with RS (53\%) and 7 of 24 sera from patients with AS (29\%) contained antibodies that bound to a synthesized peptide sequence representing residues 69-84 of HLA B27.1. In contrast, only 1 of 22 sera from healthy, B27+ controls (5\%) contained antibodies to this peptide (p less than 0.01). Sera from three HLA B27- patients with RS did not possess antibodies to the HLA B27 peptide. Additionally, greater than 40\% of HLA B27 patients with AS or RS had antibodies to Klebsiella residues 184-193, while none of the normal nonarthritic HLA B27 haplotype subjects did. Our results suggest that an autoimmune response(s) directed against HLA B27.1 may be a pathogenic mechanism in a subset of patients with AS and RS. Further, this response may initially be induced against Klebsiella pneumoniae, a microorganism that shares sequence homology with HLA B27.},

Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients.

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-1-24},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network concepts are increasingly used in biology and genetics. For example, the clustering coefficient has been used to understand network architecture; the connectivity (also known as degree) has been used to screen for cancer targets; and the topological overlap matrix has been used to define modules and to annotate genes. Dozens of potentially useful network concepts are known from graph theory.
RESULTS: Here we study network concepts in special types of networks, which we refer to as approximately factorizable networks. In these networks, the pairwise connection strength (adjacency) between 2 network nodes can be factored into node specific contributions, named node 'conformity'. The node conformity turns out to be highly related to the connectivity. To provide a formalism for relating network concepts to each other, we define three types of network concepts: fundamental-, conformity-based-, and approximate conformity-based concepts. Fundamental concepts include the standard definitions of connectivity, density, centralization, heterogeneity, clustering coefficient, and topological overlap. The approximate conformity-based analogs of fundamental network concepts have several theoretical advantages. First, they allow one to derive simple relationships between seemingly disparate networks concepts. For example, we derive simple relationships between the clustering coefficient, the heterogeneity, the density, the centralization, and the topological overlap. The second advantage of approximate conformity-based network concepts is that they allow one to show that fundamental network concepts can be approximated by simple functions of the connectivity in module networks.
CONCLUSION: Using protein-protein interaction, gene co-expression, and simulated data, we show that a) many networks comprised of module nodes are approximately factorizable and b) in these types of networks, simple relationships exist between seemingly disparate network concepts.

	abstract = {Uveitis is a complex multifactorial autoimmune disease of the eye characterized by inflammation of the uvea and retina, degeneration of the retina, and blindness in genetically predisposed patients. Using the rat model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), we previously identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with EAU on rat chromosomes 4, 12, and 10 (Eau1, Eau2, and Eau3). The primary goal of the current study is to delineate additional non-MHC chromosomal regions that control susceptibility to EAU, and to identify any QTLs that overlap with the QTLs of other autoimmune diseases. Using a set of informative microsatellite markers and F(2) generations of resistant and susceptible MHC class II-matched rat strains (F344 and LEW), we have identified several new significant or suggestive QTLs on rat chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 10, and 19 that control susceptibility to EAU. A protective allele was identified in the susceptible LEW strain in the Eau5 locus at D7Wox18, and epistatic interactions between QTLs were found to influence the severity of disease. The newly identified regions (Eau4 through Eau9) colocalize with the genetic determinants of other autoimmune disease models, and to disease-regulating syntenic regions identified in autoimmune patients on human chromosomes 4q21-31, 5q31-33, 16q22-24, 17p11-q12, 20q11-13, and 22q12-13. Our results suggest that uveitis shares some of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with other autoimmune diseases, and lends support to the "common gene, common pathway" hypothesis for autoimmune disorders.},

Th17 development is promoted by IL-23. Ankylosing spondylitis, the most common spondyloarthritis (SpA), is genetically associated with both HLA-B27 (B27) and IL-23R polymorphisms; however, the link remains unexplained. We have previously shown that B27 can form H chain dimers (termed B27(2)), which, unlike classical HLA-B27, bind the killer-cell Ig-like receptor KIR3DL2. In this article, we show that B27(2)-expressing APCs stimulate the survival, proliferation, and IL-17 production of KIR3DL2(+) CD4 T cells. KIR3DL2(+) CD4 T cells are expanded and enriched for IL-17 production in the blood and synovial fluid of patients with SpA. Despite KIR3DL2(+) cells comprising a mean of just 15\% of CD4 T in the peripheral blood of SpA patients, this subset accounted for 70\% of the observed increase in Th17 numbers in SpA patients compared with control subjects. TCR-stimulated peripheral blood KIR3DL2(+) CD4 T cell lines from SpA patients secreted 4-fold more IL-17 than KIR3DL2(+) lines from controls or KIR3DL2(-) CD4 T cells. Strikingly, KIR3DL2(+) CD4 T cells account for the majority of peripheral blood CD4 T cell IL-23R expression and produce more IL-17 in the presence of IL-23. Our findings link HLA-B27 with IL-17 production and suggest new therapeutic strategies in ankylosing spondylitis/SpA.},

Currently, the inclusion/exclusion criteria mostly depend on ad-hoc expert opinion or naïve threshold by sample size or platform. There are pressing needs to develop a systematic QC methodology as the decision of study inclusion greatly impacts the final meta-analysis outcome. In this article, we propose six quantitative quality control measures, covering internal homogeneity of coexpression structure among studies, external consistency of coexpression pattern with pathway database, and accuracy and consistency of differentially expressed gene detection or enriched pathway identification. Each quality control index is defined as the minus log transformed P values from formal hypothesis testing. Principal component analysis biplots and a standardized mean rank are applied to assist visualization and decision. We applied the proposed method to 4 large-scale examples, combining 7 brain cancer, 9 prostate cancer, 8 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 17 major depressive disorder studies, respectively. The identified problematic studies were further scrutinized for potential technical or biological causes of their lower quality to determine their exclusion from meta-analysis.

The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix GeneChip.

The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals ∼30–50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe set definitions.},

When no prior knowledge of linkage exists, and one aims to detect linkage and heterogeneity simultaneously, classical distribution theory of log-likelihood ratios does not hold. Despite some theoretical work on this problem, no generally accepted practical guidelines exist. Nor has anyone rigorously examined the combined effect of testing for linkage and heterogeneity and simultaneously maximizing over two genetic models (dominant, recessive). The effect of linkage phase represents another uninvestigated issue. Using computer simulation, we investigated type I error (P value) of the "admixture" heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) score, i.e., the LOD score maximized over both recombination fraction theta and admixture parameter alpha and we compared this with the P values when one maximizes only with respect to theta (i.e., the standard LOD score). We generated datasets of phase-known and -unknown nuclear families, sizes k = 2, 4, and 6 children, under fully penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance. We analyzed these datasets (1) assuming a single genetic model, and maximizing the HLOD over theta and alpha; and (2) maximizing the HLOD additionally over two dominance models (dominant vs. recessive), then subtracting a 0.3 correction. For both (1) and (2), P values increased with family size k; rose less for phase-unknown families than for phase-known ones, with the former approaching the latter as k increased; and did not exceed the one-sided mixture distribution xi = (1/2) chi1(2) + (1/2) chi2(2). Thus, maximizing the HLOD over theta and alpha appears to add considerably less than an additional degree of freedom to the associated chi1(2) distribution. We conclude with practical guidelines for linkage investigators.},

Also iritis and uveitis can be serious complications of AS that can damage the eye and impair vision. The exact pathogenesis of AS remains poorly understood but genetic factors play a key role in its development. Human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) is the major genetic susceptibility marker in AS. To our knowledge, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphisms have not yet been investigated in AS patients in Turkish population.This study was conducted in Turkish patients with AS to determine the frequency of I/D polymorphism genotypes of angiotensin converting enzyme gene.
METHODS: Genomic DNA obtained from 262 persons (122 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 140 healthy controls) was used in the study. ACE I/D polymorphism genotypes were determined by using polymerase chain reaction with specific primers.
RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to genotype distribution (p{\textless}0.001). When we examine ACE genotype frequencies according to the clinical characteristics there was a statistically significant association between DD genotype and ocular involvement (p=0.04) also sacroiliac joint involvement (p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of our study, angiotensin converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism DD genotype could be a genetic marker in ankylosing spondylitis in a Turkish study population.},

We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive l\_1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright \& Jordan (2006)), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by spinal inflammation, progressive spinal rigidity, and peripheral arthritis. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is thought to be a key inflammatory cytokine in the development of ankylosing spondylitis, the prototypical form of spondyloarthritis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.
METHODS: We did a randomised double-blind proof-of-concept study at eight centres in Europe (four in Germany, two in the Netherlands, and two in the UK). Patients aged 18-65 years were randomly assigned (in a 4:1 ratio) to either intravenous secukinumab (2×10 mg/kg) or placebo, given 3 weeks apart. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated block randomisation list without a stratification process. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 20\% response according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for improvement (ASAS20) at week 6 (Bayesian analysis). Safety was assessed up to week 28. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00809159.
FINDINGS: 37 patients with moderate-to-severe ankylosing spondylitis were screened, and 30 were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous secukinumab (n=24) or placebo (n=6). The final efficacy analysis included 23 patients receiving secukinumab and six patients receiving placebo, and the safety analysis included all 30 patients. At week 6, ASAS20 response estimates were 59\% on secukinumab versus 24\% on placebo (99·8\% probability that secukinumab is superior to placebo). One serious adverse event (subcutaneous abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus) occurred in the secukinumab-treated group.
INTERPRETATION: Secukinumab rapidly reduced clinical or biological signs of active ankylosing spondylitis and was well tolerated. It is the first targeted therapy that we know of that is an alternative to tumour necrosis factor inhibition to reach its primary endpoint in a phase 2 trial.

	abstract = {Efforts to find disease genes using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps will produce data sets that exceed the limitations of current computational tools. Here we describe a new, efficient method for the analysis of dense genetic maps in pedigree data that provides extremely fast solutions to common problems such as allele-sharing analyses and haplotyping. We show that sparse binary trees represent patterns of gene flow in general pedigrees in a parsimonious manner, and derive a family of related algorithms for pedigree traversal. With these trees, exact likelihood calculations can be carried out efficiently for single markers or for multiple linked markers. Using an approximate multipoint calculation that ignores the unlikely possibility of a large number of recombinants further improves speed and provides accurate solutions in dense maps with thousands of markers. Our multipoint engine for rapid likelihood inference (Merlin) is a computer program that uses sparse inheritance trees for pedigree analysis; it performs rapid haplotyping, genotype error detection and affected pair linkage analyses and can handle more markers than other pedigree analysis packages.},

This review summarizes mechanisms that have been suggested to be involved in this protective effect of HLA-B27, and highlights possible lessons for the role of HLA-B27 in spondyloarthritis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies linked protection by HLA-B27 in HIV and HCV infection to virological mechanisms such as a complicated pathways of viral escape from immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted virus-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes. In addition, several immunological mechanisms have been proposed, including CD8+ T-cell polyfunctionality and functional avidity, thymic selection of CD8+ T-cell precursors, specific T-cell receptor repertoires and clonotypes, efficient antigen processing, and evasion from regulatory T-cell-mediated suppression.
SUMMARY: Multiple virological and immunological mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to HLA-B27-mediated protection in HIV and HCV infection. Some of these mechanisms may also be involved in HLA-B27-associated pathogenesis in spondyloarthritis.},

Homozygosity mapping in this family showed lack of linkage to any of the previously known AR-OI genes, but revealed a 10.27 MB homozygous region on chromosome 8p in the two affected sibs, which comprised the procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) endopeptidase gene BMP1. Mutation analysis identified both patients with a Phe249Leu homozygous missense change within the BMP1 protease domain involving a residue, which is conserved in all members of the astacin group of metalloproteases. Type I procollagen analysis in supernatants from cultured fibroblasts demonstrated abnormal PICP processing in patient-derived cells consistent with the mutation causing decreased BMP1 function. This was further confirmed by overexpressing wild type and mutant BMP1 longer isoform (mammalian Tolloid protein [mTLD]) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human primary fibroblasts. While overproduction of normal mTLD resulted in a large proportion of proα1(I) in the culture media being C-terminally processed, proα1(I) cleavage was not enhanced by an excess of the mutant protein, proving that the Phe249Leu mutation leads to a BMP1/mTLD protein with deficient PICP proteolytic activity. We conclude that BMP1 is an additional gene mutated in AR-OI.},

Herceptin therapy provides effective treatment in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, although a favorable treatment response is not achieved in all cases. Here, we show that Herceptin treatment induces a dose-dependent growth reduction in breast cancer cell lines with HER2 amplification, whereas nonamplified cell lines are practically resistant. Time-course analysis of global gene expression patterns in amplified and nonamplified cell lines indicated a major change in transcript levels between 24 and 48 h of Herceptin treatment. A step-wise gene selection algorithm revealed a set of 439 genes whose temporal expression profiles differed most between the amplified and nonamplified cell lines. The discriminatory power of these genes was confirmed by both hierarchical clustering and self-organizing map analyses. In the amplified cell lines, the Herceptin treatment induced the expression of several genes involved in RNA processing and DNA repair, while cell adhesion mediators and known oncogenes, such as c-FOS and c-KIT, were downregulated. These results provide additional clues to the downstream effects of blocking the HER2 pathway in breast cancer and may provide new targets for more effective treatment.},

The argument criticizes Gene Set Enrichment Analysis's nonparametric nature and its use of an empirical null distribution as unnecessary and hard to compute. We refute these claims by careful consideration of the assumptions of the simplified method and its results, including a comparison with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis's on a large benchmark set of 50 datasets. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that gene-gene correlations cannot be ignored due to the significant variance inflation they produced on the enrichment scores and should be taken into account when estimating gene set enrichment significance. In addition, we discuss the challenges that the complex correlation structure and multi-modality of gene sets pose more generally for gene set enrichment methods.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the recurrence of manifestations belonging to the spectrum of spondylarthropathy (SpA) in first-degree relatives of patients with SpA, and to estimate the recurrence risk ratio.
METHODS: Parents and siblings of consecutive SpA probands have been thoroughly investigated, including clinical data collection, pelvic x ray and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 status determination. The diagnosis of SpA was made according to European Spondylarthropathy Study Group and/or the Amor criteria. The recurrence risk ratio lambda(1), which gives an estimate of the weight of genetic factors, was calculated as the ratio of the recurrence risk of SpA in first-degree relatives compared with the population prevalence of SpA. The lambda(non-HLA) was obtained by similar calculations restricted to HLA-B27+ individuals.
RESULTS: Most manifestations of SpA were more frequent among the 157 HLA-B27+ relatives of 83 probands than among their 111 HLA-B27- relatives. A diagnosis of SpA was made in 50 relatives of 31 (37\%) probands. Recurrence was very similar between parents and siblings, without gender difference, resulting in overall recurrence risk of 12\% in first-degree relatives and of 22.7\% in HLA-B27+ relatives. The lambda(1) value was 40 and the lambda(non-HLA) value was 6.5, very close to the lambda(HLA) value of 6.25 estimated from linkage study in SpA.
CONCLUSIONS: A similar recurrence risk of SpA was observed between parents and siblings, consistent with a model of inheritance with no dominance variance and without sex influence. The weight of the non-HLA genetic component was equivalent to that estimated for the HLA locus, and fitted a model of multiplicative interaction between HLA and non-HLA genetic components.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) has been associated with increased risk and severity of atherosclerotic disease in the general population. Since ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, we aimed to assess whether OPG levels correlate with disease activity, systemic inflammation, metabolic syndrome, adipokines and biomarkers of endothelial cell activation in patients with AS undergoing TNF-α antagonist therapy.
METHODS: We assessed OPG plasma concentration in 30 non-diabetic AS patients without cardiovascular disease undergoing TNF-α antagonist-infliximab therapy. OPG levels were measured immediately before and after an infliximab infusion. Correlations of OPG levels with disease activity, clinical characteristics, systemic inflammation, metabolic syndrome features, adipokines and biomarkers of endothelial activation were assessed. Changes in OPG concentration following an infusion of anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody-infliximab were also analysed.
RESULTS: We found a positive correlation between OPG levels and markers of disease activity such as BASDAI and VAS spinal pain (r=0.497, p=0.01; r=0.390; p=0.04, respectively). No differences in OPG levels according to specific clinical features of the disease were seen. An inverse correlation between OPG levels and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was also found (r=-0.451; p=0.02 and r=-0.411; p=0.03, respectively). A correlation between OPG and asymmetric dimethylarginine, a biomarker of endothelial cell activation, was also disclosed (r=0.533; p=0.01). No correlation between OPG level and insulin resistance was observed. An infliximab infusion did not lead to a significant reduction in OPG levels.
CONCLUSIONS: OPG shows a correlation with markers of disease activity and endothelial activation in non-diabetic ankylosing spondylitis patients undergoing TNF-α antagonist therapy.},

	abstract = {Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a strong genetic predisposition dominated by the role of HLA-B27. However, the contribution of other genes to the disease susceptibility has been clearly demonstrated. We previously reported significant evidence of linkage of SpA to chromosome 9q31-34. The current study aimed to characterize this locus, named SPA2. First, we performed a fine linkage mapping of SPA2 (24 cM) with 28 microsatellite markers in 149 multiplex families, which allowed us to reduce the area of investigation to an 18 cM (13 Mb) locus delimited by the markers D9S279 and D9S112. Second, we constructed a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of this region with 1,536 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 136 families (263 patients). The association was assessed using a transmission disequilibrium test. One tag SNP, rs4979459, yielded a significant P-value (4.9 x 10(-5)). Third, we performed an extension association study with rs4979459 and 30 surrounding SNPs in LD with it, in 287 families (668 patients), and in a sample of 139 cases and 163 controls. Strong association was observed in both familial and case/control datasets for several SNPs. In the replication study, carried with 8 SNPs in an independent sample of 232 cases and 149 controls, one SNP, rs6478105, yielded a nominal P-value{\textless}3 x 10(-2). Pooled case/control study (371 cases and 312 controls) as well as combined analysis of extension and replication data showed very significant association (P{\textless}5 x 10(-4)) for 6 of the 8 latter markers (rs7849556, rs10817669, rs10759734, rs6478105, rs10982396, and rs10733612). Finally, haplotype association investigations identified a strongly associated haplotype (P{\textless}8.8 x 10(-5)) consisting of these 6 SNPs and located in the direct vicinity of the TNFSF15 gene. In conclusion, we have identified within the SPA2 locus a haplotype strongly associated with predisposition to SpA which is located near to TNFSF15, one of the major candidate genes in this region.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare continuous and on-demand NSAID treatment with respect to their ability to suppress radiographic progression in subgroups of patients with high/elevated CRP-levels, ESR, ASDAS-levels or BASDAI-levels in comparison to patients with normal levels.
METHODS: Post-hoc analyses were performed in a randomized trial comparing continuous and on-demand NSAID treatment. Relevant high/elevated subgroups were created based on time-averaged (ta) CRP ({\textgreater}5mg/L), ta-ESR ({\textgreater}12mm/hr), ta-BASDAI ({\textgreater}4), ta-ASDAS-CRP ({\textgreater}2.1) and ta-ASDAS-ESR ({\textgreater}2.1). Subgroups were further split according to NSAID-use (continuous vs. on-demand). Radiological progression was presented in probability plots. Statistical interactions were tested using multiple and logistic regression analysis. Differences in radiological progression were analysed using the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: 150 participants randomized to either the continuous-treatment group (n=76), or the on-demand group (n=74) had complete radiographs and were included. The effect of slowing radiological progression with continuous NSAID therapy was more pronounced in patients with elevated ta-CRP-levels, elevated ta-ESR, high ta-ASDAS-CRP or high ta-ASDAS-ESR versus patients with low/normal values. No such effect was found for participants with high vs. low BASDAI. Also, in participants with elevated ta-ESR (irrespective of treatment), there appeared to be a higher rate of structural progression than in participants with normal ta-ESR. Regression analyses showed that continuous NSAID treatment neutralizes the negative effect of inflammation (high ta-ESR).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elevated acute phase reactants seem to benefit most from continuous treatment with NSAIDs. Continuous NSAID-therapy in patients with elevated acute phase reactants may lead to an improved benefit-risk-ratio of these drugs.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses, and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems. HLA typing for HLA-B27, HLA-B60, and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers, and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers. Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx, using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS.
RESULTS: Six of 8 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were disease concordant, compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (27\%) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall (12.5\%). Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins. HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands, and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1. Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97\% of the population variance.
CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined, and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous. HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS.},

METHODS: Human cartilage was obtained from femoral heads at joint replacement for OA or following fracture to the femoral neck. Total RNA was purified, and gene expression was assayed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Several members of the above gene families were regulated in OA. Genes that showed increased expression in OA were MMP13, MMP28, and ADAMTS16 (all at P {\textless} 0.001), MMP9, MMP16, ADAMTS2, and ADAMTS14 (all at P {\textless} 0.01), and MMP2, TIMP3, and ADAMTS12 (all at P {\textless} 0.05). Genes with decreased expression in OA were MMP1, MMP3, and ADAMTS1 (all at P {\textless} 0.001), MMP10, TIMP1, and ADAMTS9 (all at P {\textless} 0.01), and TIMP4, ADAMTS5, and ADAMTS15 (all at P {\textless} 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that groups of genes across the gene families were coexpressed in cartilage.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive expression profile of all known MMP, ADAMTS, and TIMP genes in cartilage. Elucidation of patterns of expression provides a foundation with which to understand mechanisms of gene regulation in OA and potentially to refine the specificity of antiproteolytic therapies.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate new classification criteria for peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) in patients with SpA with peripheral manifestations only.
Methods In this Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) study, two prespecified sets of criteria were compared against the European Spondylarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) and Amor criteria in newly referred consecutive patients with undiagnosed peripheral arthritis, and/or enthesitis, and/or dactylitis that usually began before 45 years of age. The clinical diagnosis (SpA vs no SpA) made by the ASAS rheumatologist served as reference standard.
Results In all, 24 ASAS centres included 266 patients, with a final diagnosis of SpA being made in 66.2\%. After adjustments a final set of criteria showed the best balance between sensitivity (77.8\%) and specificity (82.9\%): arthritis and/or enthesitis and/or dactylitis plus (A) one or more of the following parameters: psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, preceding infection, human leucocyte antigen B27, uveitis, sacroiliitis on imaging, or (B) two or more other parameters: arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, inflammatory back pain in the past, family history of SpA. The new criteria performed better than modified versions of the ESSG (sensitivity 62.5\%, specificity 81.1\%) and the Amor criteria (sensitivity 39.8\%, specificity 97.8\%), particularly regarding sensitivity. In the entire ASAS population of 975 patients the combined use of ASAS criteria for axial SpA and ASAS criteria for peripheral SpA also had a better balance (sensitivity 79.5\%, specificity 83.3\%) than the modified ESSG (sensitivity 79.1\%, specificity 68.8\%) and Amor criteria (sensitivity 67.5\%, specificity 86.7\%), respectively.
Conclusions The new ASAS classification criteria for peripheral SpA performed well in patients presenting with peripheral arthritis, enthesitis and/or dactylitis.},

WebGestalt is composed of four modules: gene set management, information retrieval, organization/visualization, and statistics. The management module uploads, saves, retrieves and deletes gene sets, as well as performs Boolean operations to generate the unions, intersections or differences between different gene sets. The information retrieval module currently retrieves information for up to 20 attributes for all genes in a gene set. The organization/visualization module organizes and visualizes gene sets in various biological contexts, including Gene Ontology, tissue expression pattern, chromosome distribution, metabolic and signaling pathways, protein domain information and publications. The statistics module recommends and performs statistical tests to suggest biological areas that are important to a gene set and warrant further investigation. In order to demonstrate the use of WebGestalt, we have generated 48 gene sets with genes over-represented in various human tissue types. Exploration of all the 48 gene sets using WebGestalt is available for the public at http://genereg.ornl.gov/webgestalt/wg\_enrich.php.},

We found some hub nodes (e.g. miR-16 and miR-26) in this network are important regulators, and the network can be severed as a bridge to interpret the associations of previous results, which is shown by the case of miR-29 in this study. We also constructed a regulatory network for MI recurrence and found several important genes (e.g. DAB2, BMP6, miR-320 and miR-103), the abnormal expressions of which may be potential regulatory mechanisms and markers of MI recurrence. At last we proposed a cellular model to discuss major TF and miRNA regulators with signaling pathways in MI.

Unrestrained activation of the immune system against commensal bacteria appears to be responsible for the chronicity of these diseases. In animal models, broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the bacterial load and militate against intestinal inflammation. Several bacterial species found in of the common microflora, including anaerobes, are able to invade the colonic wall when there is dysfunction of the colonic mucosal barrier. Most aerobes provoke focal areas of acute inflammation, but some anaerobes in the predominant flora induce diffuse a fibrogenic transmural response. Current research aims to identify the probiotics that might act against these bacteria. Colonization with specific probiotic strains, including a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-10, prevents spontaneous colitis in susceptible mice. Certain lactobacilli exhibit anti-inflammatory properties naturally, i.e. without previous genetic manipulation. Prebiotics may increase colonization by lactobacilli and can prevent mucosal inflammation. Modulation of the gut flora with probiotics may prove useful in the prevention and control of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

	abstract = {It is well known that maximizing the maximum LOD score over multiple parameter values or models (i.e., the method of mod scores, or MMLS), will inflate type I error, compared with assuming only one parameter value/model in the linkage analysis. On the other hand, a mod score often has greater power to detect linkage than does a LOD score (Z) calculated under a wrong genetic model. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the actual magnitude of type I error in realistic genetic situations. Simulated data sets with no linkage were generated under three dominant and three recessive single-locus models, with reduced penetrance (f = .8, .5, and .2). Data sets were analyzed for linkage by (1) maximizing over penetrance only, (2) maximizing over "dominance model" (i.e., dominant versus recessive), and (3) maximizing over both penetrance and dominance model simultaneously. In (1), the resultant significance levels were approximately doubled, compared with baseline values if one had not maximized over penetrances (i.e., compared with a one-sided chi2(1)). In (2), significance levels were increased somewhat less, and, in (3), they were increased by approximately two to three times (but not more than four times) over those of the one-sided chi2(1). This means that, for a given size of test alpha, an investigator would need to increase the Z used as a test criterion, by approximately 0.30 LOD units for analyses as in (1) or (2) and by 0.60 Z units for analyses as in (3). These guidelines, which are valid up to approximately Z = 3.0, are conservative for (1) and are very conservative for (2) and (3). By quantifying the increase in significance level (or, correspondingly, the increase in Z), our findings will enable users to rationally assess the advantages versus the disadvantages of mod scores.},

Here we describe methods for the prospective isolation and purification of astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes from developing and mature mouse forebrain. We used FACS (fluorescent-activated cell sorting) to isolate astrocytes from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of an S100β promoter. Using Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays, we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of {\textgreater}20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main CNS neural cell types at various postnatal ages between postnatal day 1 (P1) and P30. This database provides a detailed global characterization and comparison of the genes expressed by acutely isolated astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We found that Aldh1L1 is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker GFAP. Astrocytes were enriched in specific metabolic and lipid synthetic pathways, as well as the draper/Megf10 and Mertk/integrin αvβ5 phagocytic pathways suggesting that astrocytes are professional phagocytes. Our findings call into question the concept of a “glial” cell class as the gene profiles of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are as dissimilar to each other as they are to neurons. This transcriptome database of acutely isolated purified astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell-type-specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of spondylarthritis (SpA) remains largely elusive. This is related both to the complexity of the disease (axial versus peripheral disease, inflammation versus tissue remodeling) and to the difficulty in obtaining samples from primary disease sites. This study was undertaken to explore a gene expression approach for identifying novel candidate mediators of SpA.
METHODS: Sacroiliac joint fluid aspirates from 3 SpA patients with active sacroiliitis were studied by microarray analysis. The expression of selected candidate molecules in peripheral synovitis was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 4 sacroiliitis gene clusters, containing a total of 47 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Two clusters contained genes expressed in all sacroiliitis samples, corresponding to both known and unsuspected candidate mediators of SpA pathology. These included proinflammatory molecules as well as molecules involved in tissue remodeling, such as transforming growth factor beta2. Of the novel candidate genes selected for confirmation, interleukin-7 (IL-7) mRNA expression was higher in SpA peripheral synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples than in osteoarthritis samples, and similar to expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples. At the protein level, synovial fluid IL-7 levels were even higher in SpA than in RA, despite lower levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1beta.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, both known and unsuspected candidate mediators of SpA pathogenesis were identified, including IL-7.

	abstract = {To identify susceptibility loci for ankylosing spondylitis, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese. In the discovery stage, we analyzed 1,356,350 autosomal SNPs in 1,837 individuals with ankylosing spondylitis and 4,231 controls; in the validation stage, we analyzed 30 suggestive SNPs in an additional 2,100 affected individuals and 3,496 controls. We identified two new susceptibility loci between EDIL3 and HAPLN1 at 5q14.3 (rs4552569; P = 8.77 × 10−10) and within ANO6 at 12q12 (rs17095830; P = 1.63 × 10−8). We also confirmed previously reported associations in Europeans within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (top SNP, rs13202464; P {\textless} 5 × 10−324) and at 2p15 (rs10865331; P = 1.98 × 10−8). We show that rs13202464 within the MHC region mainly represents the risk effect of HLA-B*27 variants (including HLA-B*2704, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2715) in Chinese. The two newly discovered loci implicate genes related to bone formation and cartilage development, suggesting their potential involvement in the etiology of ankylosing spondylitis.},

	abstract = {Microarrays are widely used for examining differential gene expression, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms, and detecting methylation loci. Multiple testing methods in microarray data analysis aim at controlling both Type I and Type II error rates; however, real microarray data do not always fit their distribution assumptions. Smyth's ubiquitous parametric method, for example, inadequately accommodates violations of normality assumptions, resulting in inflated Type I error rates. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays, another widely used microarray data analysis method, is based on a permutation test and is robust to non-normally distributed data; however, the Significance Analysis of Microarrays method fold change criteria are problematic, and can critically alter the conclusion of a study, as a result of compositional changes of the control data set in the analysis. We propose a novel approach, combining resampling with empirical Bayes methods: the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods. This approach not only reduces false discovery rates for non-normally distributed microarray data, but it is also impervious to fold change threshold since no control data set selection is needed. Through simulation studies, sensitivities, specificities, total rejections, and false discovery rates are compared across the Smyth's parametric method, the Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods. Differences in false discovery rates controls between each approach are illustrated through a preterm delivery methylation study. The results show that the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods offer significantly higher specificity and lower false discovery rates compared to Smyth's parametric method when data are not normally distributed. The Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods also offers higher statistical power than the Significance Analysis of Microarrays method when the proportion of significantly differentially expressed genes is large for both normally and non-normally distributed data. Finally, the Resampling-based empirical Bayes Methods are generalizable to next generation sequencing RNA-seq data analysis.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

This shows thousands of genomic regulatory regions underlying the proliferative and invasive states, identifying SOX10/MITF and AP-1/TEAD as regulators, respectively. Knockdown of TEADs shows a previously unrecognized role in the invasive gene network and establishes a causative link between these transcription factors, cell invasion and sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors. Using regulatory landscapes and in silico analysis, we show that transcriptional reprogramming underlies the distinct cellular states present in melanoma. Furthermore, it reveals an essential role for the TEADs, linking it to clinically relevant mechanisms such as invasion and resistance.},

	doi = {10.1002/art.38318},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In HLA-B27-transgenic rats, the development of a disorder that mimics spondyloarthritis (SpA) is highly correlated with dendritic cell (DC) dysfunction. The present study was undertaken to analyze the underlying mechanisms of this via transcriptome analysis.
METHODS: Transcriptome analysis of ex vivo-purified splenic CD103+CD4+ DCs from B27-transgenic rats and control rats was performed. Transcriptional changes in selected genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A meta-analysis of our rat data and published data on gene expression in macrophages from ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients was further performed.
RESULTS: Interferon (IFN) signaling was the most significantly affected pathway in DCs from B27-transgenic rats; the majority of genes connected to IFN were underexpressed in B27-transgenic rats as compared to controls. This pattern was already present at disease onset, persisted over time, and was conserved in 2 disease-prone B27-transgenic rat lines. In DCs from B27-transgenic rats, we further found an up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (which may account for reverse IFN signaling) and a down-regulation of interleukin-27 (a cytokine that opposes Th17 differentiation and promotes Treg cells). The meta-analysis of data on conventional DCs from rats and data on monocyte-derived macrophages from humans revealed 7 IFN-regulated genes that were negatively regulated in both human and rat SpA (i.e., IRF1, STAT1, CXCL9, CXCL10, IFIT3, DDX60, and EPSTI1).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that expression of HLA-B27 leads to a defect in IFNγ signaling in antigen-presenting cells in both B27-transgenic rats and SpA patients, which may result in Th17 expansion and Treg cell alteration (as shown in B27-transgenic rats) and contribute to disease pathogenesis.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2474-14-354},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the spondyloarthropathies, the underlying molecular and cellular pathways driving disease are poorly understood. By undertaking a study in knee synovial biopsies from spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients we aimed to elucidate dysregulated genes and pathways.
METHODS: RNA was extracted from six SpA, two AS, three osteoarthritis (OA) and four normal control knee synovial biopsies. Whole genome expression profiling was undertaken using the Illumina DASL system, which assays 24000 cDNA probes. Differentially expressed candidate genes were then validated using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Four hundred and sixteen differentially expressed genes were identified that clearly delineated between AS/SpA and control groups. Pathway analysis showed altered gene-expression in oxidoreductase activity, B-cell associated, matrix catabolic, and metabolic pathways. Altered "myogene" profiling was also identified. The inflammatory mediator, MMP3, was strongly upregulated (5-fold) in AS/SpA samples and the Wnt pathway inhibitors DKK3 (2.7-fold) and Kremen1 (1.5-fold) were downregulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression profiling in SpA and AS samples demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is associated with both systemic inflammation as well as local tissue alterations that may underlie tissue damaging modelling and remodelling outcomes. This supports the hypothesis that initial systemic inflammation in spondyloarthropathies transfers to and persists in the local joint environment, and might subsequently mediate changes in genes directly involved in the destructive tissue remodelling.},

	abstract = {HLA-B27 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many spondyloarthropathies and in particular ankylosing spondylitis. The observation that the HLA-B27 heavy chain has a tendency to misfold has raised the possibility that associated diseases may belong in a rapidly expanding category of protein misfolding disorders. The synthesis of the HLA-B27 heavy chain, assembly with β2m and the loading of peptide cargo, occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before transport to the cell surface. The evidence indicates that misfolding occurs in the ER prior to β2m association and peptide optimization and is manifested in the formation of aberrant inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds and accumulation of heavy chain bound to the chaperone BiP. Enhanced accumulation of misfolded heavy chains during the induction of class I expression by cytokines, can cause ER stress resulting in activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)., Effects of UPR activation on cytokine production are beginning to emerge and may provide important missing links between HLA-B27 misfolding and spondyloarthritis. In this chapter we will review what has been learned about HLA-B27 misfolding in human cells and in the transgenic rat model of spondyloarthritis-like disease, considering it in the context of other protein misfolding disorders. These studies provide a framework to support much needed translational work assessing HLA-B27 misfolding and UPR activation in patient-derived material, its consequences for disease pathogenesis and ultimately how and where to focus intervention strategies.},

We identified a significant novel CD locus on chromosome 13p13.3 (peak logarithm of the odds (LOD) score=3.98) in all pedigrees, significant linkage evidence on chromosomes 1p35.1 (peak LOD score=3.5) and 3q29 (peak LOD score=3.19) in Jewish CD pedigrees, and suggestive loci for Jewish IBD on chromosome 10q22 (peak LOD score=2.57) and Jewish UC on chromosome 2q24 (peak LOD score=2.69). Nominal or greater linkage evidence was present for most previously designated IBD loci (IBD1-9), notably, IBD1 for CD families at chromosome 16q12.1 (peak LOD score=4.86) and IBD6 in non-Jewish UC families at chromosome 19p12 (peak LOD score=2.67). This study demonstrates the ability of high information content adequately powered SNP genome-wide linkage studies to identify loci not observed in multiple microsatellite-based studies in smaller cohorts.},

	abstract = {Attractor networks, which map an input space to a discrete output space, are useful for pattern completion--cleaning up noisy or missing input features. However, designing a net to have a given set of attractors is notoriously tricky; training procedures are CPU intensive and often produce spurious attractors and ill-conditioned attractor basins. These difficulties occur because each connection in the network participates in the encoding of multiple attractors. We describe an alternative formulation of attractor networks in which the encoding of knowledge is local, not distributed. Although localist attractor networks have similar dynamics to their distributed counterparts, they are much easier to work with and interpret. We propose a statistical formulation of localist attractor net dynamics, which yields a convergence proof and a mathematical interpretation of model parameters. We present simulation experiments that explore the behavior of localist attractor networks, showing that they yield few spurious attractors, and they readily exhibit two desirable properties of psychological and neurobiological models: priming (faster convergence to an attractor if the attractor has been recently visited) and gang effects (in which the presence of an attractor enhances the attractor basins of neighboring attractors).},

Although the precise etiology of SpA is unknown, there is mounting evidence that these diseases are a result of complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. In this review on SpA, we will discuss genetic variants with genome-wide significance, highlight potential clinical application of genetic variants, and discuss challenges in further elucidating the genetic basis of SpA.},

As IFN-γ is involved in many cellular processes, including activation of dendritic cells (DCs), antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion and trafficking, and cytokine and chemokine production, IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells were proposed to be integral to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Recently, IFN-γ was shown to enhance IL-23 and IL-1 production by DCs and subsequently induce Th17 cells, which are important contributors to the inflammatory cascade in psoriatic lesions. To determine whether IFN-γ indeed induces the pathways expressed in psoriatic lesions, a single intradermal injection of IFN-γ was administered to an area of clinically normal, non-lesional (NL) skin of psoriasis patients and biopsies were collected 24 hours later. Although there were no visible changes in the skin, IFN-γ induced many molecular and histological features characteristic of psoriatic lesions. IFN-γ increased a number of differentially expressed genes in the skin, including many chemokines concomitant with an influx of T cells and inflammatory DCs. Furthermore, inflammatory DC products tumor necrosis factor (TNF), inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-23, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand were present in IFN-γ-treated skin. Thus, IFN-γ, which is significantly elevated in NL skin compared with healthy skin, appears to be a key pathogenic cytokine that can induce many features of the inflammatory cascade of psoriasis.},

Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical regulators of immune responses. Under noninflammatory conditions, several human DC subsets have been identified. Little is known, however, about the human DC compartment under inflammatory conditions. Here, we characterize a DC population found in human inflammatory fluids that displayed a phenotype distinct from macrophages from the same fluids and from steady-state lymphoid organ and blood DCs. Transcriptome analysis showed that they correspond to a distinct DC subset and share gene signatures with in vitro monocyte-derived DCs. Moreover, human inflammatory DCs, but not inflammatory macrophages, stimulated autologous memory CD4+ T cells to produce interleukin-17 and induce T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells through the selective secretion of Th17 cell-polarizing cytokines. We conclude that inflammatory DCs represent a distinct human DC subset and propose that they are derived from monocytes and are involved in the induction and maintenance of Th17 cell responses.},

	abstract = {Maximum-likelihood analysis (via LOD score) provides the most powerful method for finding linkage when the mode of inheritance (MOI) is known. However, because one must assume an MOI, the application of LOD-score analysis to complex disease has been questioned. Although it is known that one can legitimately maximize the maximum LOD score with respect to genetic parameters, this approach raises three concerns: (1) multiple testing, (2) effect on power to detect linkage, and (3) adequacy of the approximate MOI for the true MOI. We evaluated the power of LOD scores to detect linkage when the true MOI was complex but a LOD score analysis assumed simple models. We simulated data from 14 different genetic models, including dominant and recessive at high (80\%) and low (20\%) penetrances, intermediate models, and several additive two-locus models. We calculated LOD scores by assuming two simple models, dominant and recessive, each with 50\% penetrance, then took the higher of the two LOD scores as the raw test statistic and corrected for multiple tests. We call this test statistic "MMLS-C." We found that the ELODs for MMLS-C are {\textgreater}=80\% of the ELOD under the true model when the ELOD for the true model is {\textgreater}=3. Similarly, the power to reach a given LOD score was usually {\textgreater}=80\% that of the true model, when the power under the true model was {\textgreater}=60\%. These results underscore that a critical factor in LOD-score analysis is the MOI at the linked locus, not that of the disease or trait per se. Thus, a limited set of simple genetic models in LOD-score analysis can work well in testing for linkage.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the different B27 subtypes to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with the sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOs) was used to analyse the polymorphism in exon 2 and 3 of HLA-B27 in two Asian groups with different genetic HLA structures: Indian (I) and Thai (T) populations. The same number of AS patients (45) and healthy B27 positive donors (n = 17) from both populations were analysed in order to ascertain the B27 subtypes. Three different findings can be concluded from this study: 1) B*2707 has been found to be associated with AS in both populations. This association has not been previously reported in either ethnic group. 2) B*2704 is strongly associated with AS in the Thai patients (91\% in AS vs. 47\% in C; RR = 11.5; EF = 0.83). In contrast, B*2704 was found with similar frequency in Asian Indians AS patients and controls (41\% in AS vs. 41\% in C.). 3) B*2706 was found overrepresented in control populations and absent in AS patients (0\% in AS vs. 47\% in C.; pc {\textless} 10(-6)) showing the maximum value of protective fraction (PF = 1). The B*2706 negative association with AS has not been previously described in other ethnic groups and could indicate a protective effect of this subtype on AS susceptibility. The B*2706 allele has two changes relative to B*2704 at residue 114 (His to Asp) and 116 (Asp to Tyr) in the pockets D/E. The importance that these differences can play in the pathogenesis of AS are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, inflammatory rheumatic disease. Physiotherapy is considered an important part of the overall management of AS.
OBJECTIVES: To summarise the available scientific evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions in the management of AS.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and PEDro up to January 2007 for all relevant publications, without any language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted the authors of included articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised studies with AS patients and where at least one of the comparison groups received physiotherapy. The main outcomes of interest were pain, stiffness, spinal mobility, physical function and patient global assessment.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.
MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials with a total of 763 participants were included in this updated review. Four trials compared individualised home exercise programs or a supervised exercise program with no intervention and reported low quality evidence for effects in spinal mobility (Relative percentage differences (RPDs) from 5-50\%) and physical function (four points on a 33-point scale). Three trials compared supervised group physiotherapy with an individualised home-exercise program and reported moderate quality evidence for small differences in spinal mobility (RPDs 7.5-18\%) and patient global assessment (1.46 cm) in favour of supervised group exercises. In one study, a three-week inpatient spa-exercise therapy followed by 37 weeks of weekly outpatient group physiotherapy (without spa) was compared with weekly outpatient group physiotherapy alone; there was moderate quality evidence for effects in pain (18\%), physical function (24\%) and patient global assessment (27\%) in favour of the combined spa-exercise therapy. One study compared daily outpatient balneotherapy and an exercise program with only exercise program, and another study compared balneotherapy with fresh water therapy. None of these studies showed significant between-group differences. One study compared an experimental exercise program with a conventional program; statistically significant change scores were reported on nearly all spinal mobility measures and physical function in favour of the experimental program.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review suggest that an individual home-based or supervised exercise program is better than no intervention; that supervised group physiotherapy is better than home exercises; and that combined inpatient spa-exercise therapy followed by group physiotherapy is better than group physiotherapy alone.},

Twelve key questions on the role of imaging in SpA were generated using a process of discussion and consensus. Imaging modalities included conventional radiography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography, single photon emission CT, dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry and scintigraphy. Experts applied research evidence obtained from systematic literature reviews using MEDLINE and EMBASE to develop a set of 10 recommendations. The strength of recommendations (SOR) was assessed by taskforce members using a visual analogue scale. A total of 7550 references were identified in the search process, from which 158 studies were included in the systematic review. Ten recommendations were produced using research-based evidence and expert opinion encompassing the role of imaging in making a diagnosis of axial SpA or peripheral SpA, monitoring inflammation and damage, predicting outcome, response to treatment, and detecting spinal fractures and osteoporosis. The SOR for each recommendation was generally very high (range 8.9-9.5). These are the first recommendations which encompass the entire spectrum of SpA and evaluate the full role of all commonly used imaging modalities. We aimed to produce recommendations that are practical and valuable in daily practice for rheumatologists, radiologists and general practitioners.},

This function appeared the prerogative of a restricted number of bacteria, the prototype of which is the segmented filamentous bacterium, a nonculturable Clostridia-related species, which could largely recapitulate the coordinated maturation of T cell responses induced by the whole mouse microbiota.

Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of 328 patients with AS and 627 healthy blood donors from Jinan region as a case-control study. The diagnosis of AS was made according to the modified New York criteria. The ERAP1 rs27044, TGBβ1 rs1800470 and TLR9 rs55704465 were genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Strong association with AS was observed for marker rs27044, but no significant differences were observed between AS patients and controls in the frequencies of the carriership of the alleles rs55704465 and rs1800470. Our data thus indicate that ERAP1 likely constitutes one of AS-associated loci of susceptibility after HLA in Chinese Han population.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods.
RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors.
CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.},

Besides standard multiple testing corrections, a new improved method for estimating the true effect of multiple testing over complex structures like GO has been introduced. Interpreting ranked gene lists is supported from the same interface with very efficient algorithms. Such ordered lists may arise when studying the most significantly affected genes from high-throughput data or genes co-expressed with the query gene. Other important aspects of practical data analysis are supported by modules tightly integrated with g:Profiler. These are: g:Convert for converting between different database identifiers; g:Orth for finding orthologous genes from other species; and g:Sorter for searching a large body of public gene expression data for co-expression. g:Profiler supports 31 different species, and underlying data is updated regularly from sources like the Ensembl database.

On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation. Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples and are computationally efficient.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We previously identified a new susceptibility region linked to SpA in 9q31-34. Tenascin-C (TNC) appears as one of the best positional and functional candidate genes lying within this SPA2 locus. The objectives of the present study were to identify TNC polymorphisms, and to examine their putative association with SpA.
METHODS: We first performed variants screening in 20 independent SpA patients from families with high linkage score to the SPA2 locus, and three unrelated controls: TNCs coding regions (28 exons), intron-exon boundaries and 5'- and 3'-flank regions were fully re-sequenced to identify polymorphisms. Then we genotyped selected variants in 183 independent trios, and assessed their intrafamilial association with SpA by transmission disequilibrium test.
RESULTS: Variants screening allowed us to identify 26 polymorphisms, 7 of which were selected for further study, in addition to an intronic polymorphism previously reported as associated with Achilles tendon injuries. In intrafamilial association test, none of the variants showed significant transmission disequilibrium. Results from analysis restricted to AS were not different from those obtained on the whole SpA group.
CONCLUSIONS: TNC was one of the best positional and functional candidate genes within the SPA2 locus. Nevertheless, we found no association between polymorphisms in this gene and SpA. However, we cannot exclude that variants located in intronic regions or in the vicinity of TNC, which were not tested in the present study, could be implicated in the predisposition to SpA.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory condition with a high degree of familiality (lambda(s) = 82) and heritability ({\textgreater}90\%) that primarily affects spinal and sacroiliac joints. Whole genome scans for linkage to AS phenotypes have been conducted, although results have been inconsistent between studies and all have had modest sample sizes. One potential solution to these issues is to combine data from multiple studies in a retrospective meta-analysis.
METHODS: The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium combined data from three whole genome linkage scans for AS (n = 3744 subjects) to determine chromosomal markers that show evidence of linkage with disease. Linkage markers typed in different centres were integrated into a consensus map to facilitate effective data pooling. We performed a weighted meta-analysis to combine the linkage results, and compared them with the three individual scans and a combined pooled scan.
RESULTS: In addition to the expected region surrounding the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6, we determined that several marker regions showed significant evidence of linkage with disease status. Regions on chromosome 10q and 16q achieved 'suggestive' evidence of linkage, and regions on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 5q, 6q, 9q, 17q and 19q showed at least nominal linkage in two or more scans and in the weighted meta-analysis. Regions previously associated with AS on chromosome 2q (the IL-1 gene cluster) and 22q (CYP2D6) exhibited nominal linkage in the meta-analysis, providing further statistical support for their involvement in susceptibility to AS.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide a useful guide for future studies aiming to identify the genes involved in this highly heritable condition.},

	abstract = {Objective
A disease resembling the human spondylarthropathies develops in HLA–B27–transgenic rats. This disease in rats is mediated by CD4+ T cells, but antigen-presenting cells (APCs) may also play a role. Dendritic cells (DCs) have been reported to be defective in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture in this model. Here, we further investigated the functional defect of APCs.
Methods
DCs and B cells from nontransgenic, HLA–B27 (33–3)–transgenic, and HLA–B7 (120–4)–transgenic rats were used to stimulate T cells. Surface expression of HLA–B transgene and rat molecules on APCs and the formation of conjugates between DCs and T cells were monitored by flow cytometry.
Results
We observed a strikingly defective stimulation of allogeneic and syngeneic T lymphocytes by APCs from HLA–B27 but not HLA–B7 rats, even if stimulation was driven in the presence of anti–T cell receptor (TCR) antibody. We found no evidence that HLA–B27 DCs were immature, lacked production of some diffusible factor, or produced an inhibitory factor for T cells. When comparing the levels of expression of class II major histocompatibility complex, CD2, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, lymphocyte function–associated antigen 1, B7, and CD40 molecules at the surface of DCs from 33-3, 120-4, and nontransgenic rats, we found little difference. However, HLA–B27–transgenic DCs formed fewer conjugates with T cells than did nontransgenic DCs. Furthermore, the proportion of conjugates formed between DCs and T cells, as well as the difference between nontransgenic and HLA–B27–transgenic DCs, were in large part reduced by blocking CD86 on DCs.
Conclusion
We confirmed defective stimulation of T cells by APCs in HLA–B27 rats, the mechanism of which appears to implicate APC/T cell contact, independent of TCR engagement. In addition, decreased use of the CD86 costimulatory molecule by B27 DCs was observed. Impaired costimulatory function could result in a loss of tolerance toward microbial flora in this model.},

Here we review the current state of the art in transcriptome sequencing and address epigenetic regulation, quantification of transcription activation, RNAseq output and a diverse set of applications for RNAseq data. We detail how RNAseq can be used to identify allele-specific expression, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations and discuss the benefits and limitations of using RNAseq to monitor DNA characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the power of combining RNA- and DNAseq methods for genomic analysis.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify ankylosing spondylitis (AS)-associated copy number variations (CNVs) in Korean subjects and their synergistic roles in the development of AS.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 309 patients with AS and 309 control subjects, using a copy number variant (CNV) microarray. AS-associated CNV regions were replicated in 2 independent sets (625 patients and 891 control subjects) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and deletion-typing PCR.
RESULTS: In the CNV GWAS, 227 CNV regions were shown to be significantly associated with the risk of AS. Of the candidate CNV regions, 9 were successfully replicated in the first replication analysis: 1q32.2 (HHAT), 1p34.2 (BMP8A), 2q31.2 (PRKRA), 6p21.32 (HLA-DPB1), 11q22.1 (CNTN5), 13q13.1 (EEF1DP3), 14q24.2 (RGS6), 16p13.3, and 22q11.1 (IL17RA). The 5 deletion-type CNV regions, in 1q32.2, 2q31.2, 6p21.32, 13q13.1, and 16p13.3, were associated with an increased risk of AS, and the other 4 CNV regions were protective. In the second replication analysis, 4 CNV regions in 1q32.2, 2q31.2, 6p21.32, and 16p13.3 were replicated. Among patients with CNV regions in ≥4 risk-increasing loci, the risk was 18.0 times higher than that in patients without any deletions (odds ratio [OR] 17.98, P = 2.3 × 10(-7) ). Among patients with CNV regions in ≥2 protective loci, the risk was 5.2 times lower than that in those without any deletions (OR 0.19, P = 4.0 × 10(-10) ). The additive effects of simultaneous events were shown to be dependent on the frequency of CNV regions. Through deletion-typing PCR and sequencing, the exact sizes and breakpoint sequences were defined in 4 CNV regions. The mechanism of all 3 deletions was shown to be microhomology-based nonhomologous end joining.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study can help to identify pathogenic mechanisms of AS and can easily be applied in the development of algorithms estimating the risk of AS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complex chronic diseases are usually not caused by changes in a single causal gene but by an unbalanced regulating network resulting from the dysfunctions of multiple genes or their products. Therefore, network based systems approach can be helpful for the identification of candidate genes related to complex diseases and their relationships. Axial spondyloarthropathy (SpA) is a group of chronic inflammatory joint diseases that mainly affect the spine and the sacroiliac joints. The pathogenesis of SpA remains largely unknown.
RESULTS: In this paper, we conducted a network study of the pathogenesis of SpA. We integrated data related to SpA, from the OMIM database, proteomics and microarray experiments of SpA, to prioritize SpA candidate disease genes in the context of human protein interactome. Based on the top ranked SpA related genes, we constructed a SpA specific PPI network, identified potential pathways associated with SpA, and finally sketched an overview of biological processes involved in the development of SpA.
CONCLUSIONS: The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and pathways reflect the link between the two pathological processes of SpA, i.e., immune mediated inflammation, as well as imbalanced bone modelling caused new boneformation and bone loss. We found that some known disease causative genes, such as TNFand ILs, play pivotal roles in this interaction.},
